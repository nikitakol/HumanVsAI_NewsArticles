business,Lse 'Sets Date For Takeover Deal',"The London Stock Exchange (LSE) is planning to announce a preferred takeover by the end of the month, newspaper reports claim. The Sunday Telegraph said the LSE's plan was further evidence it wants to retain tight control over its destiny. Both Deutsche Boerse and rival Euronext held talks with the London market last week over a possible offer. A £1.3bn offer from Deutsche Boerse has already been rejected, while Euronext has said it will make an all cash bid. Speculation suggests that Paris-based Euronext has the facilities in place to make a bid of £1.4bn, while its German rival may up its bid to the £1.5bn mark. Neither has yet tabled a formal bid, but the LSE is expected to hold further talks with the two parties later this week. However, the Sunday Telegraph report added that there are signs that Deutsche Boerse chief executive Werner Seifert is becoming increasingly impatient with the LSE's managed bid process. Despite insisting he wants to agree a recommended deal with the LSE's board, the newspaper suggested he may pull out of the process and put an offer directly to shareholders instead. The newspaper also claimed Mr Seifert was becoming ""increasingly frustrated"" with the pace of negotiations since Deutsche Boerse's £1.3bn offer was rejected in mid-December, in particular the LSE's decision to suspend talks over the Christmas period. Meanwhile, the German exchange's offer has come under fire recently. Unions for Deutsche Boerse staff in Frankfurt have reportedly expressed fears that up to 300 jobs would be moved to London if the takeover is successful. Others claim it will weaken the city's status as Europe's financial centre, while German politicians are also said to be angry over the market operator's promise to move its headquarters to London if a bid is successful. A further stumbling block is Deutsche Boerse's control over its Clearstream unit, the clearing house that processes securities transactions. LSE shareholders fear it would create a monopoly situation, weakening the position of shareholders when negotiating lower transaction fees for share dealings. LSE and Euronext do not have control over their clearing and settlement operations, a situation which critics say is more transparent and competitive.","British engineering firm Rolls-Royce has set a deadline of 23 March for firms to express an interest in buying its marine business. Companies have until 1700 GMT to submit their intentions, Rolls-Royce said in a statement. The firm announced on 3 March that it planned to sell the marine unit as part of a restructuring aimed at cutting costs. The sale process is expected to result in a cash deal worth about £2bn ($3.1bn) for the marine business. Rolls-Royce has already sold its energy unit and is expected to sell its aerospace arm by the end of 2005. The marine business makes about 10% of Rolls Royce's profits, with sales of about £800m last year. The sale process will be led by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley who were also involved in the sell-off of its power systems business. Rolls-Royce announced plans to sell off the marine unit after receiving approval from the UK Takeover Panel on 3 March. At the same time, the company revealed its third consecutive annual loss and announced plans to cut 1,600 jobs and close one plant. ""The company is committed to providing information promptly to the market and believes that a deadline for interest will facilitate this,"" said Rolls-Royce in a statement on Monday morning. Shares in Rolls Royce rose 1.3% in early trade on Monday, valuing the company at £7.3bn. Analysts said that although the deadline was welcome, the market was anxious to"
business,Oil Companies Get Russian Setback,"International oil and mining companies have reacted cautiously to Russia's decision to bar foreign firms from natural resource tenders in 2005. US oil giant Exxon said it did not plan to take part in a new tender on a project for which it had previously signed a preliminary agreement. Miner Highland Gold said it regretted any limit on privatisation while BP, a big investor, declined to comment. Only firms at least 51% Russian-owned will be permitted to bid. The Federal Natural Resources Agency said ""the government is interested in letting Russian companies develop strategic resources"". The foreign ownership issue will be dealt with according to Russia's competition law, natural resources minister Yuri Trutnev was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency. No further details were given, with Mr Trutnev suggesting that Russia may decide on a case-by-case basis. Observers said that the move may represent a shift in policy, as the administration of Vladimir Putin puts the protection of national interests above free market dynamics. Russia recently wrested back control of a large chunk of its oil industry from stock-market listed company Yukos, a move that prompted calls of outrage from many investors. Analysts warned that it was still too early to draw too many conclusions from this new set of proposals. Companies echoed this sentiment, saying that they would require more information before ringing the alarm bells. ""It's not good. But it is very understandable,"" said Al Breach, an economist at UBS Brunswick. ""But if the investment climate is stable - that's much more important. ""Foreigners of course would like to have free entry but... this is not the end of the world."" A number of other nations, including Mexico, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, protect their national resources from foreign firms. What has surprised observers is that since the collapse of communism Russia has been courting foreign investment. BP spent $7.5bn to create Russian-registered oil company TNK-BP, and has a partnership to develop the Sakhalin 5 petroleum field with state-owned Rosneft. Exxon, the world's largest oil company, has signed preliminary agreements to develop the Sakhalin 3 field. Company spokesman Glenn Waller said Exxon still considered the deal valid, despite Russia inviting new offers for the land block. According to Mr Waller, Exxon ""were not planning to bid at a new tender anyway"". ""We regret the ministry has taken such a decision,"" said Ivan Kulakov, deputy chairman of Highland Gold - a mining firm that has the motto ""Bringing Russia's Gold to Market"". ""It would be a shame if that has a negative impact on the investment climate."" Other firms that have been linked with investment in Russia include France's Total, the US-based ChevronTexaco, and miner Barrick Gold.","Russian oil giant Lukoil has lost a legal bid to block the sale of its shares in a western Siberian oil field. In a surprise ruling, a Dutch court refused to issue a temporary injunction against Dutch firm Sintez, which has agreed to buy the stake in the Priobsk field. Sintez has said it plans to pay $3.4bn (£1.8bn) for the stake, but Lukoil says the Dutch firm is acting illegally. Analysts say the court decision is likely to increase pressure on Lukoil to sell its share in Priobsk. Sintez signed an agreement with Lukoil in February to buy its 50% stake in the field, but the deal was suspended after Lukoil accused Sintez of acting illegally by exceeding its borrowing limits. The Dutch court dismissed Lukoil's request for a temporary injunction against Sintez, saying it was too soon to make a conclusive decision about whether there had been any wrongdoing. ""It is clear that this is an interim decision,"" said Neelie Kroes, the EU Competition Commissioner, who is visiting Moscow. ""The court has said that it is premature and it will take a decision later on,"" she added. Analysts say the decision could increase pressure on Lukoil, which needs cash to service its debts and pay dividends to shareholders, to agree a sale of its stake in Priobsk - also known as Prirazlomnoye - which is due to start pumping oil next"
business,Car Giant Hit By Mercedes Slump,"A slump in profitability at luxury car maker Mercedes has prompted a big drop in profits at parent DaimlerChrysler. The German-US carmaker saw fourth quarter operating profits fall to 785m euros ($1bn) from 2.4bn euros in 2003. Mercedes-Benz's woes - its profits slid to just 20m euros - obscured a strong performance from the Chrysler group whose returns met market expectations. Mercedes faces fierce competition in the luxury car sector from BMW and but hopes to revive its fortunes by 2006. Mercedes' profits over the period compared unfavourably with 2003's 784m euro figure and were well below analyst expectations of 374m euros. For the year as a whole, its operating profits fell 46% to 1.6bn euros. Sales of Mercedes' brands fell 2% as demand cooled, while revenues were affected by the weakness of the US dollar. The carmaker blamed the fall in profits on high launch costs for new models and losses from its Mercedes Smart mini-car range. Mercedes is hoping to increase productivity by 3bn euros, having negotiated 500m euros in annual savings with German workers last year. The firm said it was determined to retain Mercedes' position as the world's most successful luxury brand. However, DaimlerChrysler's shares fell 1.5% on the news. ""While all these divisions are doing well the big worries continue to surround Mercedes-Benz,"" Michael Rabb, an analyst with Bank Sal Oppenheim, told Reuters. In contrast, Chrysler enjoyed a 5% annual increase in unit sales while revenues - calculated in US dollars - rose 10%. The US division - whose marques include Dodge and Jeep - transformed a full year operating loss of 506m euros in 2003 into a 1.4bn euros profit last year. Overall, DaimlerChrysler saw worldwide vehicle sales rise 8% to 4.7 million in 2004 while total revenues added 4% to 142bn euros. Chrysler's strong performance helped the world's fifth largest carmaker boost net income by 400m euros to 2.5bn euros. ""The year 2004 shows that our strategy works well - even in such a challenging competitive environment,"" said Jurgen Schrempp, DaimlerChrysler's chairman. DaimlerChrysler took a 475m euro hit in costs stemming from a defects scandal at its joint venture, Japanese subsidiary Fuso. DaimlerChrysler last week agreed a compensation package with partner Mitsubishi Motors which will see it buy out its stake in Fuso. Looking forward, DaimerChrysler's profits are expected to be slightly higher in 2005. However, it is expecting ""significant improvements"" in profitability in 2006 as a result of a major investment in the Mercedes product range.","BMW has warned its full-year results will be hit by the slowdown in the US car market. The firm's car division, which it shares with German rival Mercedes, reported a net loss of €1.1bn (£746m) in the first quarter. BMW said the poor performance of its DaimlerChrysler (DC) joint venture meant it would not meet its full-year expectations. It said it expected a ""significantly lower"" operating profit for the unit, which has been hit by a slump in US new car sales. BMW shares fell nearly 9% after the warning. The firm said it expected operating profit for the unit to be between €1bn and €3bn for 2004, compared with an earlier forecast of between €2.5bn and €4.5bn. As well as problems facing all car makers in the US, BMW said that DC was also affected by ""high marketing costs and low market prices"". BMW itself also saw sales of cars and motorcycles fall 8% in the first quarter. However, earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) rose by 22% to €1.3bn as BMW benefited from strong demand in Europe and China. BMW's net income rose to €1.8bn in the three months to 31 March, up from €1.2bn a year ago, thanks to ""highly profitable"" sales of motorcycles and new construction projects. However, its share price dropped 9% after it announced that net"
business,Asia Quake Increases Poverty Risk,"Nearly two million people across Asia could be thrown into poverty because of the Indian Ocean tsunami, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has said. In its first overview of the disaster, the ADB said the impact on economic growth would be slight because major cities and factories escaped damage. But the blow to many low-income people could be ""enormous"". The Paris Club of rich creditor nations on Wednesday offered to freeze debts owed by tsunami-hit countries. The move was aimed at helping South Asian governments find budgets to rebuild devastated coastal areas, though so far only Sri Lanka, Indonesia and the Seychelles have indicated that they will take it up. Other countries believe their economies are strong enough to cope or wish to avoid being viewed as credit risks. ""Poverty is potentially the most important impact of this natural disaster,"" said ADB chief economist Ifzal Ali. Donor nations have promised to give $717m (£379m) in disaster relief over the next six months, according to the United Nations. Mr Ali added his voice to those warning that aid pledges must be promptly delivered, saying the number of people at risk of poverty hinged on ""concerns over sanitation and health conditions, and other basic needs"" being ""properly and quickly addressed"". There are 1.9 billion people in Asia living on less than $2 a day. The ADB fears that 1 million Indonesians could join them, while in India just over half a million people - 645,000 - are at risk of falling into poverty. A quarter of a million Sri Lankans and 23,500 people in the Maldives are also facing poverty. In the Maldives, where 43% of the population already lives on less than $2 a day, this could rise to half. Sri Lanka and the Maldives are the two countries the ADB fears are most at risk of suffering lasting economic damage from the tsunami. Sri Lanka's government has estimated reconstruction costs at nearly $3bn. A government task force held meetings to discuss an emergency rebuilding plan with the ADB, World Bank and Japanese aid agencies on Wednesday, and promised to publish the plan within 10 days. Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and India have enjoyed strong economic growth in recent years, which should cushion them against reconstruction costs. Although Indonesia's northern province of Aceh suffered the worst death toll, the region's oil and natural gas production facilities ""have survived intact"", the report said. However, it remains too soon to asses the damage to poor people's livelihoods in Aceh because it would depend on how much farm land had been flooded by seawater. ""This is a profoundly tragic event for the region and for the millions who are suffering. But the economies of the affected countries except Sri Lanka and the Maldives should emerge with minimal damage,"" the ADB report said. Some businesses may even gain from the reconstruction efforts, thereby creating jobs. At a meeting in Thailand, ABD president Thadao Chino said he was confident of the country's ""own capabilities to restore normalcy to the affected areas and meet the rehabilitation requirements"". Thailand has said it does not wish to opt for a debt repayment freeze, while India has also rejected international aid, saying it can cope on its own resources. Debt repayment holidays carry the risk of credit ratings downgrades, making it more expensive to borrow money in future. Indonesia, however, is pressing for greater help with its debts than the current freeze would bring. It is one of the world's most indebted countries.","The risk of millions of people going hungry has increased after the massive damage caused by the Indian Ocean tsunami, aid agencies have warned. The immediate priorities are to get food and shelter to millions of people whose lives have been disrupted. But in the longer term, aid agencies fear the rebuilding effort may fail to help the world's poorest people. The World Food Programme (WFP) estimates that 10 million people have been directly affected by the tsunami disaster. ""The impact on hunger and nutrition will be felt for years to come,"" WFP's director James Morris told BBC News Online. ""The humanitarian community has a very big challenge on its hands."" He said that getting food to people in affected areas was a major priority. But he warned that it was already proving difficult because roads and ports had been damaged, and because many of the fishermen who usually transport supplies had themselves been displaced. ""In the short term, this is going to be a logistical nightmare,"" he said. And he said that aid agencies would have to ensure that they were not just rebuilding what had been destroyed, and were instead helping people create self-sufficient communities. Oxfam's humanitarian director Caroline Hurford agreed that many of the world's poorest people would be hardest hit. Many live in remote areas, or rely on agriculture for their livelihoods, she said. ""Those who are poorest are often those who are most vulnerable,"" she added. ""Agencies have to make sure they don't forget about them."" Ms Hurford said that"
business,Uk Interest Rates Held At 4.75%,"The Bank of England has left interest rates on hold again at 4.75%, in a widely-predicted move. Rates went up five times from November 2003 - as the bank sought to cool the housing market and consumer debt - but have remained unchanged since August. Recent data has indicated a slowdown in manufacturing and consumer spending, as well as in mortgage approvals. And retail sales disappointed over Christmas, with analysts putting the drop down to less consumer confidence. Rising interest rates and the accompanying slowdown in the housing market have knocked consumers' optimism, causing a sharp fall in demand for expensive goods, according to a report earlier this week from the British Retail Consortium. The BRC said Britain's retailers had endured their worst Christmas in a decade. ""Today's no change decision is correct,"" said David Frost, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC). ""But, if there are clear signs that the economy slows, the MPC should be ready to take quick corrective action and cut rates. ""Dismal reports from the retail trade about Christmas sales are worrying, if they indicate a more general weakening in consumer spending."" Mr Frost added: ""The housing market outlook remains highly uncertain. ""It is widely accepted that, if house prices start falling more sharply, the risks facing the economy will worsen considerably."" CBI chief economist Ian McCafferty said the economy had ""slowed in recent months in response to rate rises"" but that it was difficult to gauge from the Christmas period the likely pace of activity through the summer. ""The Bank is having to juggle the emergence of inflationary pressures, driven by a tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices, against the risk of an over-abrupt slowdown in consumer activity,"" he said. ""Interest rates are likely to remain on hold for some time."" On Thursday there was more gloomy news on the manufacturing front, as the Office for National (ONS) statistics revealed British manufacturing output unexpectedly fell in November - for the fifth month in the past six. The ONS said manufacturing output dropped 0.1% in November, matching a similar unrevised fall in October and confounding economists' expectations of a 0.3% rise. Manufacturers' organisation, the EEF, said it expected the hold in interest rates to continue in the near future. It also said there was evidence that manufacturers' confidence may be waning as the outlook for the world economy becomes more uncertain. ""So far the evidence suggests that last year's rate increases have helped to rebalance the economy without damaging the recovery in manufacturing,"" said EEF chief economist, Steve Radley. ""However, should the business outlook start to deteriorate, the Bank should stand ready to cut rates."" Some economists have predicted rates will drop later in the year, although others feel the Bank may still think there is a need for a rise to 5% before that happens. The Bank remains concerned about the long-term risks posed by personal debt - which is rising at 15% a year - if economic conditions worsen.","The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to hold UK interest rates at 4.75% despite signs of a slowdown in the UK economy in recent months. The nine-member MPC voted unanimously to keep rates at their record low of 4.75% after its two-day meeting ended on Tuesday. The Bank's chief economist Charles Bean said it was right to take ""some reassurance"" from recent data on consumer spending and housing. Rates have been held at their current level since February. Before the announcement, most economists had tipped the MPC to leave rates unchanged. The decision to keep rates on hold was made despite the fact that inflation remains above the Bank's 2% target, with consumer price inflation (CPI) running at an annual rate of 3.1% in January. But Mr Bean, who votes on interest rates on occasion, said that inflation was likely to stay comfortably below the 2% target in the medium term. ""While recent data have provided some reassurance that the adverse shocks which led us to cut interest rates last August have now largely played out, there are also signs that domestic demand is softening,"" he said. ""At this meeting, all members of the committee took some reassurance from recent data pointing to a rebound in consumer spending and house prices, and from survey evidence suggesting that firms' short-term hiring intentions remain positive."" He added: ""All members agreed that, given the continued uncertainty over how much growth will be"
business,Mci Shareholder Sues To Stop Bid,"A shareholder in US phone firm MCI has taken legal action to halt a $6.75bn (£3.6bn) buyout by telecoms giant Verizon, hoping to get a better deal. The lawsuit was filed on Friday after Qwest Communications, which had an earlier offer for MCI rejected, said it would submit an improved bid. MCI's directors have backed Verizon, despite it tabling less money. They are accused of breaching their fiduciary duties by depriving MCI shareholders ""of maximum value"". According the legal papers filed in a Delaware court, Verizon is set to pay an """"unconscionable, unfair and grossly inadequate"" sum for MCI, which was formerly known as Worldcom. Qwest said on Wednesday that MCI had rejected a deal worth $8bn. A number of large MCI shareholders expressed unhappiness at the decision, saying that Verizon's offer, made up of cash, shares and dividends, undervalued the company. Friday's lawsuit argues that the Verizon offer makes no provision for future growth prospects and that consolidation in the US phone industry will put a premium on MCI's network, assets and clients. MCI's directors have argued that Verizon is bigger than Qwest, has fewer debts and has built a successful mobile division. Chief executive Michael Capellas spent last week meeting with shareholders in an effort to win their backing. In 2002, investors in the then-named Worldcom lost millions when the company filed for bankruptcy following an accounting scandal. However, the firm - now renamed MCI - has put its operations in order and emerged from bankruptcy protection last April. It is a long-distance and corporate phone firm, and would provide the buyer with access to a global telecommunications network and a large number of business-based subscribers. MCI shares jumped on Friday, hitting their highest level since April 2004 amid speculation that it would be the focus of a bidding war. A takeover of MCI would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since October as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases. Earlier this month, SBC Communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone pioneer AT&T for about $16bn.","A shareholder in MCI, the phone company which hopes to merge with rival Verizon, has filed a lawsuit to stop the planned takeover. Marc Raspin, who owns 50 shares in MCI, says the $6.75bn (£3.8bn) deal will dilute the value of his holdings. Verizon, one of the US phone giants, is expected to formally announce its offer later on Wednesday, after MCI's board meets to consider it. MCI agreed a deal in December to be taken over by Verizon Communications. But the new offer from Verizon is a cash-and-stock bid that would dilute the value of existing MCI shareholders' holdings. Mr Raspin is being helped by a group called Shareholders Opposed to Corporate Greed (Sock), which is also trying to block the planned merger through legal means. In a lawsuit filed on Tuesday, he asked the US District Court in Manhattan to block the offer and enjoin - or order - MCI's board to rescind its December agreement with Verizon. ""MCI shareholders should not be forced to vote on a merger agreement unless there is a reasonable chance that it will be approved,"" Mr Raspin said in a statement. ""MCI's board has refused to do that, despite overwhelming shareholder opposition."" Sock says it owns more than one million shares in MCI, but only Mr Raspin has taken legal action so far. Verizon, which is also trying to buy Advance PCS,"
business,Wmc Says Xstrata Bid Is Too Low,"Australian mining firm WMC Resources has said it is worth up to 30% more than a hostile 7.4bn Australian dollar ($5.8bn; £3bn) bid by rival Xstrata. There is now pressure on Swiss-based Xstrata to increase its takeover offer. A report from investment firm Grant Samuel in WMC defence documents values WMC shares at A$7.17 to A$8.24, against Xstrata's bid of A$6.35 a share. Analysts said the defence documents provided more details on WMC, and may trigger a possible rival bid. ""If a bid is going to emerge it is probably likely in the next one to two weeks,"" said Daiwa Securities analyst Mark Pervan. He said the valuation would put increased pressure on Xstrata to look at ""sweetening"" its offer. Marc Gonsalves, an executive at Xstrata, said: ""We will review the information contained in the target's statement over the next week or so."" He added: ""While we will review the assumptions made by Grant Samuel in detail, we are extremely sceptical of their conclusion, and suggest that WMC shareholders take extreme care in presuming that these optimistic assumptions are capable of being realised."" Last month Australia's competition watchdog said it would not oppose the purchase of WMC by Zurich and London-based Xstrata. On Tuesday, WMC chairman Tommie Bergman said in a statement the directors believed it was in shareholders' best interest to reject the offer. He said WMC would pursue ""value-creating options"" provided by a portfolio of ""world class assets"". And WMC chief executive Andrew Michelmore claimed the Xstrata offer was aimed at creating value for Xstrata's shareholders, and was not being made for the benefit of WMC's shareholders. Grant Samuel said its valuation of WMC was based on lower average prices for nickel, copper and uranium than current market levels. ""Any longer term commodity price improvements would only improve our outlook,"" Mr Michelmore said. In 2003 Xstrata acquired Australia's largest copper miner - MIM Holdings. WMC Resources is the world's third-largest producer of concentrated nickel, and also a miner of copper and uranium. It owns the Olympic Dam mine in South Australia, which contains about one-third of the world's known uranium resources and is also the world's fourth largest copper mine. Xstrata is a global mining giant with operations in Australia, South Africa, Spain, Germany, Argentina and the UK. Its core products are copper, coking coal, thermal coal, ferrochrome, vanadium and zinc. It also has growing businesses in gold, lead and silver.","Xstrata's £4bn bid for miner Lonmin is too low and the offer should be at least £4.50 a share, mining group Xstrata has said. But Lonmin has rejected the call, saying Xstrata's offer is fair and its bid is full and final. The firms have been in talks since Xstrata made a surprise £4bn offer for Lonmin on 4 February. Xstrata has already raised its offer once to make the current bid, valuing Lonmin shares at £4.35. London-based Lonmin is South Africa's third-biggest gold miner and also produces platinum and other minerals. Its shareholders have been divided on the bid, with some believing the offer undervalues the company while others believe it is too generous. Xstrata's statement came after Lonmin had called on its rival to state clearly whether it would raise its offer again. ""Lonmin has repeatedly stated that it will not engage in discussions if Xstrata were to raise its offer further,"" said Lonmin in a statement. ""Xstrata must therefore state clearly whether it will or will not make a further increase."" But Xstrata said: ""We remain of the view that the offer is full and fair and recommend that shareholders tender their shares in order to realise this full and fair value for their shares."" The hostile approach from Lonmin could prove damaging for both companies, warned analysts, with any chance of a friendly deal now unlikely"
business,Brussels Raps Mobile Call Charges,"The European Commission has written to the mobile phone operators Vodafone and T-Mobile to challenge ""the high rates"" they charge for international roaming. In letters sent to the two companies, the Commission alleged the firms were abusing their dominant market position in the German mobile phone market. It is the second time Vodafone has come under the Commission's scrutiny. The UK operator is already appealing against allegations that its UK roaming rates are ""unfair and excessive"". Vodafone's response to the Commission's letter was defiant. ""We believe the roaming market is competitive and we expect to resist the charges,"" said a Vodafone spokesman. ""However we will need time to examine the statement of objections in detail before we formally respond."" The Commission's investigation into Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom's T-Mobile centres on the tariffs the two companies charge foreign mobile operators to access their networks when subscribers of those foreign operators use their mobile phones in Germany. The Commission believes these wholesale prices are too high and that the excess is passed on to consumers. ""The Commission aims to ensure that European consumers are not overcharged when they use their mobile phones on their travels around the European Union,"" the Commission said in a statement. Vodafone and O2, Britain's other big mobile phone operator, were sent similar statements of objections by the Commission in July last year. Vodafone sent the Commission a response to those allegations in December last year and is now waiting for a reply. The Vodafone spokesman said a similar process would be set in motion with these latest statement of objections about its operations in Germany. The companies will have three months to respond to the Commission's allegations and the process ""may go on for some time yet"", the spokesman said. The Commission could charge the companies up to 10% of their annual turnover, though in practice that sort of figure is rarely demanded. The Commission's latest move comes just a few months after national telecoms regulators across Europe launched a joint investigation which could lead to people being charged less for using their mobile phone when travelling abroad. The investigation involves regulators assessing whether there is effective competition in the roaming market.","EU regulators say they will not accept more increases in the cost of making mobile phone calls. The European Commission has issued a ""final warning"" to the industry after prices rose by more than 50% in 2005. It says it will not hesitate to take action against operators who raise prices further. The warning came as a survey found that consumers still face some of the highest call charges in the developed world. The European Commission (EC) said it will take action against operators who may have broken previous voluntary price agreements. ""We are not going to accept any more price rises,"" EU Consumer Affairs Commissioner Meglena Kuneva said. Ms Kuneva said that 58% of consumers' mobile phone bills were made up of call charges - compared with an EU average of 41%. According to regulator Ofcom, consumers pay an average of 59p per minute to make a UK mobile phone call - the fourth highest rate in the developed world. ""It is unacceptable that consumers still pay such high prices for mobile phone services,"" Ms Kuneva added. She said that the Commission would continue negotiations with operators over ""fair and reasonable"" charges. The EC issued a similar warning in December when it threatened legal action against operators if they did not lower prices. At the time, operators promised to cut charges for text messages and Internet access - but these reductions have yet to be implemented in all EU countries. A survey by auditing and accountancy firm Deloitte found that consumers in Finland, Italy, Latvia,"
business,Mcdonald'S Boss Bell Dies Aged 44,"Charlie Bell, the straight-talking former head of fast-food giant McDonald's, has died of cancer aged 44. Mr Bell was diagnosed with colorectal cancer in May last year, a month after taking over the top job. He resigned in November to fight the illness. Joining the company as a 15-year-old part-time worker, Mr Bell quickly moved through its ranks, becoming Australia's youngest store manager at 19. A popular go-getter, he is credited with helping revive McDonald's sales. Mr Bell leaves a wife and daughter. ""As we mourn his passing, I ask you to keep Charlie's family in your hearts and prayers,"" chief executive James Skinner said in a statement. ""And remember that in his abbreviated time on this earth, Charlie lived life to the fullest."" ""No matter what cards life dealt, Charlie stayed centred on his love for his family and for McDonald's."" After running the company's Australian business in the 1990s, Mr Bell moved to the US in 1999 to run operations in Asia, Africa and the Middle East. In 2001, he took over the reins in Europe, McDonald's second most important market. He became chief operating officer and president in 2002. Mr Bell took over as chief executive after his predecessor as CEO, Jim Cantalupo, died suddenly of a heart attack in April. Having worked closely with Mr Cantalupo, who came out of retirement to turn McDonald's around, Mr Bell focused on boosting demand at existing restaurants rather than follow a policy of rapid expansion. He had promised not to let the company get ""fat, dumb and happy,"" and, according to Reuters, once told analysts that he would shove a fire hose down the throat of competitors if he saw them drowning. Mr Bell oversaw McDonald's ""I'm lovin' it"" advertising campaign and introduced successes such as McCafe, now the biggest coffee shop brand in Australia and New Zealand. Colleagues said that Mr Bell was proud of his humble beginnings, helping out behind cash tills and clearing tables when visiting restaurants.","UK fast food firm McDonald's has paid tribute to its former chief executive Jim Cantwell who has died aged 44. Mr Cantwell led the firm through one of its most turbulent periods, including two lawsuits in the US. He died on Saturday after suffering a heart attack while on holiday in Florida aged 44. In a statement, McDonald's said it was a ""sad loss"" and he will be ""greatly missed"". The company said Mr Cantwell had led McDonald's through ""one of its most successful periods"" and had made a ""significant contribution to the business"". Mr Cantwell replaced Mike Roberts as chief executive in May 2001 and led the company through a series of legal cases in the US, including one where it was accused of making children obese. McDonald's settled both cases this year. US lawyer Samuel Hirsch filed a lawsuit in 2001 accusing the company of making children obese and misleading customers about the nutritional content of its food. Mr Cantwell settled the case, which cost the company an estimated $3bn (£1.9bn), in August 2004. A second lawsuit from two California teenagers was settled this year when McDonald's agreed to post calorie counts on its menus in California. Mr Cantwell was also involved in settling a long-running dispute with Britain's McStrike workers and led the firm through tough economic times. He stepped down in September 2004 to be replaced by Charlie Bell, who is credited with turning around KFC in Britain. McDonald's UK managing director Amanda Cooper said:"
business,Executive Trio Leave Aer Lingus,"Three senior executives of Ireland's state-owned airline, Aer Lingus, are set to leave early on 28 January after accusations of a conflict of interest. The trio are chief executive Willie Walsh, chief financial officer Brian Dunne and chief operations officer Seamus Kearney. The three have refused to confirm reports they plan to launch a private airline in competition with Aer Lingus. They announced in November they would quit in May, but did not give a reason. That decision had followed an announcement by Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern - who is still considering the future of the airline - which ruled out a proposed management buy-out of Aer Lingus. Mr Walsh denied they had been forced out early because of the reports claiming they were set to launch a competitor airline. ""What I do after I leave Aer Lingus is still too early to say,"" Mr Walsh told AP news agency on Wednesday. ""I have opportunities open to me. Brian and Seamus are in the equally fortunate position."" He said he had received more than 40 business proposals, mostly aviation-related, since the trio announced their resignations two months ago. Mr Walsh said there was no conflict of interest, and, if he was to launch a rival airline or join an existing competitor, ""this thing happens in every business"". ""There's absolutely no question of a conflict of interest. I've been completely focused on my responsibilities at Aer Lingus,"" he told AP. This week opposition politicians had called on the Irish government to make an urgent decision on the future of the airline. On Wednesday Irish Transport Minister Martin Cullen said in a statement: ""A conflict of interest cannot, should not and will not be allowed to arise between their current roles at Aer Lingus and their future career intentions."" Last Friday the minister had announced he was to advertise for three senior executives for Aer Lingus. Mr Walsh, who took charge in 2000, and his team have earned praise for turning Aer Lingus around, by cutting air fares and staff, and re-positioning it as a low-fare airline to rival Ryanair. The company is 85% owned by the government and 15% by its staff.","The management board of Aer Lingus has resigned after its parent group, the Irish government, refused to back a pay rise for the airline's chief executive. Five of the airline's nine-strong board have quit after talks about a £1m pay package for Declan Ryan fell through. The government said it was concerned about the size of the proposed rise after Aer Lingus' profits halved last year. Meanwhile, pilots at Aer Lingus have threatened to disrupt flights from Monday unless the government agrees to talks. They are seeking pay rises similar to those given to their colleagues at Ryanair and other airlines. Mr Ryan left Aer Lingus in September 2004, six months into a three-year contract, after it emerged that he had accepted hospitality from a Dublin brothel owner. The government appointed former KLM executive Padraig Fallon to succeed him and he was later joined by Willie Walsh, former chief executive of Ireland's flagship carrier. Within weeks of their appointments, Mr Fallon and Mr Walsh asked the government for permission to pay Mr Ryan up to £1m a year to return as chief executive. But Finance Minister Charlie McCreevy refused to give his consent after launching an inquiry into the proposed pay rise. In a statement, Mr McCreevy said: ""In light of these developments and in view of its fiduciary responsibilities, the government has decided not to endorse the proposed contract between Aer Lingus and Declan Ryan."" The five board members who have resigned - including chairman Des Crowley"
business,The 'Ticking Budget' Facing The Us,"The budget proposals laid out by the administration of US President George W Bush are highly controversial. The Washington-based Economic Policy Institute, which tends to be critical of the President, looks at possible fault lines. US politicians and citizens of all political persuasions are in for a dose of shock therapy. Without major changes in current policies and political prejudices, the federal budget simply cannot hold together. News coverage of the Bush budget will be dominated by debates about spending cuts, but the fact is these will be large cuts in small programs. From the standpoint of the big fiscal trends, the cuts are gratuitous and the big budget train wreck is yet to come. Under direct threat will be the federal government's ability to make good on its debts to the Social Security Trust Fund. As soon as 2018, the fund will begin to require some cash returns on its bond holdings in order to finance all promised benefits. The trigger for the coming shock will be rising federal debt, which will grow in 10 years, by conservative estimates, to more than half the nation's total annual output. This upward trend will force increased borrowing by the federal government, putting upward pressure on interest rates faced by consumers and business. Even now, a growing share of US borrowing is from abroad. The US Government cannot finance its operations without heavy borrowing from the central banks of Japan and China, among other nations. This does not bode well for US influence in the world. The decline of the dollar is a warning sign that current economic trends cannot continue. The dollar is already sinking. Before too long, credit markets are likely to react, and interest rates will creep upwards. That will be the shock. Interest-sensitive industries will feel pain immediately - sectors such as housing, automobiles, other consumer durables, agriculture, and small business. Some will recall the news footage of angry farmers driving their heavy equipment around the US Capitol in the late 1970s. There will be no need for constitutional amendments to balance the budget. The public outcry will force Congress to act. Whether it will act wisely is another matter. How did this happen? By definition, the deficit means too little revenue and too much spending - but this neutral description doesn't adequately capture the current situation. Federal revenues are at 1950s levels, while spending remains where it has been in recent decades - much higher. In addition, the United States has two significant military missions. The Bush administration's chosen remedy is the least feasible one. Reducing domestic spending, or eliminating ""waste, fraud and abuse"" is toothless because this slice of the budget is too small to solve the problem. Indeed, if Congress were rash enough to balance the budget in this way, there would hardly be any such spending left. Law enforcement, space exploration, environmental clean-up, economic development, the Small Business Administration, housing, veterans' benefits, aid to state and local governments would all but disappear. It's fantasy to think these routine government functions could be slashed. The biggest spending growth areas are defence (including homeland security), and health care for the elderly and the poor. To some extent, increases in these areas are inevitable. The US population is aging, and the nation does face genuine threats in the world. But serious savings can only be found where the big money is. Savings in health care spending that do not come at the expense of health can only be achieved with wholesale reform of the entire system, public and private. Brute force budget cuts or spending caps would ill-serve the nation's elderly and indigent. On the revenue side, the lion's share of revenue lost to tax cuts enacted since 2000 will have to be replaced. Some rearranging could hold many people harmless and focus most of the pain on those with relatively high incomes. Finally, blind allegiance to a balanced budget will have to be abandoned. There is no good reason to fixate on it, anyway. Moderate deficits and slowly rising federal debt can be sustained indefinitely. Borrowing for investments in education and infrastructure that pay off in future years makes sense. The sooner we face that reality, the sooner workable reforms can be pursued. First on the list should be tax reform to raise revenue, simplify the tax code, and restore some fairness eroded by the Bush tax cuts. Second should be a dispassionate re-evaluation of the huge increase in defence spending over the past three years, much of it unrelated to Afghanistan, Iraq, or terrorism. Third must be the start of a serious debate on large-scale health care reform. One thing is certain - destroying the budget in order to save it is not going to equip the US economy and government for the challenges of this new century.","America's obesity crisis, an ageing population and the costs of the war in Iraq are piling pressure on the US budget, experts say. The US faces a ""ticking fiscal time bomb"" unless it reins in spending, said a panel of experts who appeared before Congress on Friday. The group warned that massive budget deficits could lead to the US being bankrupt by 2020. The Congressional Budget Office has predicted that the US will run up a deficit of $1.4 trillion in the current fiscal year. But other analysts say that there is still time to fix the problem. ""We are not facing a fiscal crisis right now,"" said William Cline, senior research fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ""If we were to close all of the budget gap today, it would take until 2016 before economic growth is meaningfully affected."" The panel of experts told the House Budget Committee that the US faced a wave of bills for programmes such as Medicare and Medicaid, as well as social security. By 2020, social security, Medicare and Medicaid will account for more than half of all federal spending, they said. The cost of the war in Iraq could also become a much bigger burden on the budget in future years. Right now, each additional $1 billion spent on Iraq is adding about $1.2 billion to the deficit, said Alice Rivlin, former director of the White House Office of Management and Budget. But as US troops pull back from major cities and move into more static positions, costs could climb"
business,Markets Signal Brazilian Recovery,"The Brazilian stock market has risen to a record high as investors display growing confidence in the durability of the country's economic recovery. The main Bovespa index on the Sao Paolo Stock Exchange closed at 24,997 points on Friday, topping the previous record market close reached the previous day. The market's buoyancy reflects optimism about the Brazilian economy, which could grow by as much as 4.5% in 2004. Brazil is recovering from last year's recession - its worst in a decade. Economic output declined 0.2% in 2003 and President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva - elected as Brazil's first working-class president in 2002 - was strongly criticised for pursuing a hardline economic policy. Investors have praised his handling of the economy as foreign investment has risen, unemployment has fallen and inflation has been brought under control. Analysts believe the stock market will rise above the 25,000 mark for the first time before too long. ""There should be more space for gains until the end of the year, somewhere up to 27,000 points,"" said Paschoal Tadeu Buonomo, head of equities trading at brokers TOV. Brazil's currency, the real, also rose to its highest level against the dollar in more than two years on Friday. Although interest rates still stand at a punitive 17.25%, inflation has fallen from 9% to 7% while exports are booming, particularly of agricultural products. ""For the first time in decades, we have all three economic policy pillars in line during a recovery,"" Finance Minister Antonio Palocci told the Associated Press news agency. ""Government accounts are in surplus, we have a current account surplus and inflation is under control."" Investors were deeply suspicious of President da Silva, a former trade union leader who campaigned on a programme of extensive land redistribution and a large rise in the minimum wage. However, Mr da Silva has stuck to an orthodox monetary policy inherited from his predecessor even in the face of last year's economic crisis. This has earned him the disapproval of rural farm workers, thousands of whom who took to the streets of Brasilia on Thursday to protest against government policies. President da Silva has defended his policies, arguing that Brazil cannot afford to continue the cycle of boom and bust which afflicted it in recent decades.","Stock markets in Brazil and neighbouring Chile have been performing strongly in recent months. In the last two weeks, the Santiago stock exchange has hit a 17-year high, while the Brazilian equivalent has touched its highest level since late 2001. So is this a sign that Brazil is at last emerging from its worst recession in decades? Not quite. Actually, the rise in Brazil's benchmark stock index, the Bovespa, has been driven more by changes in the exchange rate than by any signs of recovery in the economy. The real has strengthened against the US dollar by about 10% in the last couple of months. That makes Brazilian exports cheaper and helps firms sell their products abroad, but makes imports more expensive and crimps domestic activity. For example, the price of a McDonald's hamburger in Sao Paulo has shot up from about $1.50 to about $2.50 over the last few months because of the stronger real. On the other side of the coin, it also makes it more expensive for Brazilian firms to import goods and services such as technology and materials. Furthermore, a strong real is one of the factors that has led to price rises for many basic goods such as food and fuel - putting even more pressure on consumers' budgets. So while a stronger currency is a big help to exporters, it also puts companies under pressure - at least until they get used to it and adapt. As far as investors are concerned, they like a strong real because it makes their Brazilian investments look more"
business,French Suitor Holds Lse Meeting,"European stock market Euronext has met with the London Stock Exchange (LSE) amid speculation that it may be ready to launch a cash bid. Euronext chief Jean-Francois Theodore held talks with LSE boss Clara Furse the day after rival Deutsche Boerse put forward its own bid case. The German exchange said it had held ""constructive, professional and friendly"" talks with the LSE. But Euronext declined to comment after the talks ended on Friday. Speculation is mounting that the Germans may raise their bid to £1.5bn. Deutsche Boerse previously offered £1.3bn, which was rejected by the LSE, while Euronext is rumoured to have facilities in place to fund a £1.4bn cash bid. So far, however, neither have tabled a formal bid. But a deal with either bidder would create the biggest stock market operator in Europe and the second biggest in the world after the New York Stock Exchange. There was speculation Euronext would use Friday's meeting as an opportunity to take advantage of growing disquiet over Deutsche Boerse's own plans for dominance over the London market. Unions for Deutsche Boerse staff in Frankfurt has reportedly expressed fears that up to 300 jobs would be moved to London if the takeover is successful. ""The works council has expressed concerns that the equities and derivatives trade could be managed from London in the future,"" Reuters news agency reports a union source as saying. German politicians are also said to be angry over the market operator's promise to move its headquarters to London if a bid were successful. Meanwhile, LSE shareholders fear that Deutsche Boerse's control over its Clearstream unit - the clearing house that processes securities transactions - would create a monopoly situation. This would weaken the position of shareholders when negotiating lower transaction fees for share dealings. LSE and Euronext do not have control over their clearing and settlement operations, a situation which critics say is more transparent and competitive. The German group's ownership of Clearstream has been seen as the main stumbling block to a London-Frankfurt merger. Commentators believe Deutsche Boerse, which has now formally asked German authorities to approve its plan to buy the LSE, may offer to sell Clearstream to gain shareholder approval. Euronext, so far, has given little away as to what sweeteners it will offer the LSE - Europe's biggest equity market - into a deal.","A group of French investors hoping to buy the bulk of London Stock Exchange has held talks with the UK firm's board. Xavier Rolet, the LSE chief executive, met representatives of the Euronext bidding group on Thursday. The meeting was aimed at clearing up ""a few misunderstandings"" according to a spokesman for Euronext. A takeover would be a landmark in UK financial history. The LSE is currently preparing for its £3.5bn flotation on the London market later this month. Euronext has so far been reluctant to comment on its intentions other than to say that it is considering all options. The group, which is made up of French, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg stock market owners, is thought to be preparing a formal bid for the LSE within weeks. It believes that buying the LSE would allow it to create a pan-European stock market and give its members a bigger say in the running of the International Securities Market (Isda). The LSE was formed through the merger of the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe) with the London Stock Exchange in 2001. The Liffe arm was bought by Euronext's four members - NYSE Euronext, Deutsche Borse, Borsa Italiana and Euronext - as part of a deal which gave them a 20% stake in the LSE and seats on the board. The move was seen as paving the way for an offer for the whole company but weeks"
business,Air Passengers Win New Eu Rights,"Air passengers who are unable to board their flights because of overbooking, cancellations or flight delays can now demand greater compensation. New EU rules set compensation at between 250 euros (£173) and 600 euros, depending on the length of the flight. The new rules will apply to all scheduled and charter flights, including budget airlines. Airlines have attacked the legislation saying they could be forced to push prices higher to cover the extra cost. The European Commission is facing two legal challenges - one from the European Low-fare Airlines Association (ELAA) and the other from the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which has attacked the package as a ""bad piece of legislation"". Previously, passengers could claim between 150 euros and 300 euros if they had been stopped from boarding. However, only scheduled flight operators were obliged to offer compensation in cases of overbooking and they did not have to offer compensation for flight cancellations. The EU decided to increase passenger compensation in a bid to deter airlines from deliberately overbooking flights. Overbooking can often lead to 'bumping' - when a passenger is moved to a later flight. When this happens against a passenger's will, airlines will now have to offer compensation. In addition, if a flight is cancelled or delayed for more than two hours through the fault of the airline, all passengers must be paid compensation. However, airlines do not have to offer compensation if flights are cancelled or delayed due to ""extraordinary circumstances"". Airlines fear that ""extraordinary circumstances"" may not include bad weather, security alerts or strikes - events which are outside of their control. All EU-based airlines and operators of flights which take off from the EU will have to adhere to the new compensation regime which came into force on Thursday. Low-cost airlines have criticised the new compensation levels, arguing that the pay-out could be worth more than the ticket. ""It's a preposterous piece of legislation, we among all airlines are fighting this,"" Ryanair deputy chief executive Michael Cawley told Radio 4's Today programme. The European Regions Airline Association (ERAA) claims that neither airlines nor consumers were consulted over the changes. Andy Clarke, ERAA director of air transport, said that the EC advice misleads customers as it leads them to believe that airlines could be liable for payouts if flights are delayed because of bad weather. EC spokeswoman Marja Quillinan-Meiland conceded there were ""grey areas"" but said ""these are not as big as the airlines are making out"". In cases of dispute, national enforcement bodies would decide whether the passenger had a case, she said. New technology means it is easier for airlines to take off and land in bad weather, she added. The ERAA's Mr Clarke also warned that while airlines would comply with the new rules, the extra costs would be passed onto passengers. ""We reckon it's going to cost European air passengers - not the airlines, the airlines have no money, it has to be paid by passengers - 1.5bn euros, that's over £1bn a year loaded onto European passengers,"" Mr Clarke said. ""That's basically a transfer of money from passengers whose journeys are not disrupted to passengers whose journeys are disrupted."" On Wednesday, Jacques Barrot, vice president of the European Commission and also Commissioner for Transport, said that the changes were necessary. ""The boom in air travel needs to be accompanied by proper protection of passengers' right."" ""This is a concrete example of how the Union benefits people's daily lives,"" he added. The EC has launched an information campaign in airports and travel agencies to inform airline passengers of their new rights.","Passengers flying within Europe are to get more legal protection as part of a package of changes aimed at making air travel less of a lottery. Fliers will get cash compensation for delayed and cancelled flights, and airline staff will have to behave more politely. Airlines will also have to publish punctuality figures, starting in 2007. But consumer groups said the package did not go far enough and there were still no rules on ownership and transparency in the aviation industry. Fliers have won some protection from the European Court of Justice, which has ruled that airlines have to pay compensation for delays caused by technical problems. Under EU rules, airlines have to pay up to £300 for delays of over three hours on short-haul flights and up to £1,000 for long-haul flights. But the court ruled that airlines did not have to compensate passengers if the delay was due to circumstances beyond their control. In its ruling on the legality of the current system, the court said: ""In light of their economic situation, small and medium-sized airlines must be allowed to adapt themselves to such circumstances without being exposed to heavy financial losses."" The European Commission said it would now look at making sure that any new rules it makes would conform with the ruling. As part of its package of proposals, the European Commission wants airlines to offer cash compensation for flight delays of over three hours on short-haul flights - something they are not currently obliged to do. They will also have to do more to help passengers stranded by cancelled flights"
business,Businesses Fail To Plan For Hiv,"Companies fail to draw up plans to cope with HIV/Aids until it affects 20% of people in a country, new research says. The finding comes in a report published on Thursday by the World Economic Forum, Harvard and the UN aids agency. ""Too few companies are responding proactively to the social and business threats,"" said Dr Kate Taylor, head of the WEF's global Health Initiative. Nearly 9,000 business leaders in 104 countries were surveyed for Business and HIV/AIDS: Commitment and Action? Dr Taylor described the level of action taken by businesses as revealed by the report as ""too little, too late"". The issue will be highlighted to business and world leaders at the World Economic Forum, which meets in Davos, Switzerland, next week. The WEF report shows that despite the fact that 14,000 people contract HIV/Aids every day, concern among businesses has dropped by 23% in the last 12 months. Most (71%) have no policies in place to address the disease. Nor could over 65% of the business leaders surveyed say or estimate the prevalence of HIV among their staff. The UN programme tackling Aids, UNAIDS, pointed out that having a clear strategy for dealing with HIV/Aids was a good investment as well as being socially responsible. One company that does have a plan is Anglo-American, the international mining company, which estimates an HIV prevalence of 24% among its 130,000-strong Southern African workforce. Over the last two years the company has implemented extensive voluntary counselling and testing for HIV infection, coupled with anti-retroviral therapy for employees progressing to Aids. Over 90% of the 2,200 employees who have accessed and remained on treatment are well and have returned to normal work. ""Effective action on HIV/Aids is synonymous with good business management and leads to more profitable and sustainable operations,"" said Brian Brink, senior vice-president, health, at Anglo-American. ""Companies should encourage all workers to know their HIV status, making it as routine as monitoring blood pressure or cholesterol,"" he said. ""Providing access to treatment is a critical part of this."" Across sub-Saharan Africa, even in countries with an HIV prevalence of 10-19%, only around 7% of companies have formal HIV/Aids policies in place, according to the report. The gap is even wider in China, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria and Russia, the so-called ""next wave"" countries, which are predicted to experience the highest numbers of new HIV/Aids cases worldwide by 2010. The report adds ""an important building block to our understanding of how the business community is experiencing the HIV/Aids epidemic and to whether and how it is reacting,"" said David Bloom, professor of economics and demography at the Harvard School of Public Health. The WEF report concludes that businesses need to understand their exposure to HIV/Aids risks and come up with good local practices to manage them. A key priority, in both high and low-prevalence settings, said the WEF is to establish a policy based on non-discrimination and confidentiality.","Six out of 10 small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) have failed to put measures in place to protect them from a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) outbreak, a survey has found. Only 30% of firms with fewer than 500 employees questioned had plans to ensure staff could keep working in the event of an epidemic. The government is currently considering relaxing UK HIV testing rules. The survey was carried out by recruitment firm Randstad, ahead of World Aids Day on 1 December. ""Our survey has revealed that 90% of SMEs do not have an HIV/Aids policy in place,"" said Randstad's UK chief executive officer Jean Pierre Bacqu�. ""If there was an HIV epidemic, nearly three quarters of these businesses would not be able to continue trading."" As many as a quarter of the UK's 5,000 annual HIV cases are currently acquired in the workplace. The government is considering proposals to end the requirement for doctors and nurses to seek special permission before asking patients for their consent to carry out an HIV test. Currently, a patient can only be tested without consent if they are unconscious or their condition makes it impossible to give their permission. The move is being considered as part of the government's review into the Control of HIV Risk Act which governs HIV testing in the UK. Currently, testing is permitted only if there is a risk of transmission between patients and medical staff or between patients and other patients. Campaigners have argued that such changes are needed to"
business,Water Firm Suez In Argentina Row,"A conflict between the Argentine State and water firm Aguas Argentinas, controlled by France's Suez, is casting doubt on the firm's future. The firm, which serves the province of Buenos Aires, wants a tariff rise of 60% to fund water-supply improvements. The government has rejected the 60% rise and wants Aguas Argentinas to make an annual investment of 400m pesos ($136m; £72.3m) in improvements. Planning Minister Julio De Vido has offered State help but not for ""free"". Mr De Vido said that the Argentine state would not make a contribution ""in the form of a subsidy"". He has said a contribution could be made in return for a seat on the company's board. He added that the government is in discussions with Aguas Argentinas about what role it might take in the event that a State contribution is agreed. However, Aguas Argentinas told the Argentine newspaper Clarin it would not accept any change to its legal structure and, in practice, this rules out State participation on its board. The Planning Minister didn't rule out the possibility of cancelling Aguas Argentinas water concession. Yet he added that he didn't like to do ""futurology"". But last week, Argentine Economic Minister, Roberto Lavagna, told the French media in Paris that the government was considering allowing a 16% increase in tariffs and the possibility of a State contribution to Aguas Argentinas infrastructure investments. Speaking in Buenos Aires, Mr De Vido later denied the possibility of any tariff increase and insisted that the annual investment in water infrastructure was at the centre of the discussions. He added that in the coming weeks the future of Aguas Argentinas would be decided. Suez owns 40% of Aguas Argentinas (39.9%), while Spain's Aguas de Barcelona is its second biggest shareholder with 25.01%. Recently, Suez lost a water concession in Bolivia after mass protests in the city of El Alto (the poorest in the country), with citizens complaining of unfair water charges. This forced the government to cancel the contract. In Argentina, Suez's subsidiary, which has been fined for cutting the supply of water during a recent heat wave and allegedly failing to keep up investment to meet the demand for water, has maintained a tense relationship with the Argentine government. During the last financial crisis in Argentina, the firm sued the state alleging that converting its tariffs from US dollars to pesos, and then freezing them during devaluation, had affected the company and made it difficult for it to meet its contractual obligations. When President Nestor Kirchner of Argentina arrived in power he began to negotiate a solution to the disagreements with international utilities operating in Argentina. But he has rejected any tariff increases, alleging this will impoverish citizens further. He has also asked for more investments to meet the growing demand for water. On May 2004, Aguas Argentinas and the government signed an agreement to renegotiate its Buenos Aires water-concession contract. The firm agreed to invest 242m pesos. The issue has attracted European interest. Last week in Paris, President Kirchner discussed this problem and other issues with French president Jacques Chirac. The Argentine government is also under pressure from European Union countries and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to raise utilities tariffs, because most of the utilities operating in Argentina are European.","Water utility firm Suez is taking legal action against the Argentine government over unpaid bills. It has filed a lawsuit in New York to try to recover money owed by the state-run water company Aguas Argentinas. Suez is also seeking a ruling to force the company to pay its debts in future. The Buenos Aires-based company owes Suez $100m (£50m) for work already done and has stopped making payments, the French firm says. Aguas Argentinas said the legal action had no grounds and that it would answer in court. Suez has operated in Argentina for more than 40 years, providing consultancy services as well as operating some water and sewage treatment plants. But it says Aguas Argentinas has refused to pay bills for work done since 2002 and has asked Suez to renegotiate its contract. ""We have filed a complaint for commercial arbitration against Aguas Argentinas in New York,"" said Suez spokeswoman Catherine Gaudin. ""We have not received any money from them since December 2003,"" she added. Suez claims that it has been hit by the Argentinian government's decision to remove export limits on water bills imposed by privatised utilities for customers who did not pay their bills. Aguas Argentinas is 70% owned by the Buenos Aires city council with the rest held by the province of Buenos Aires and some private investors. The company supplies water to two million households in Buenos Aires and surrounding areas. It also provides water to companies that produce food and drink products"
business,Air China In $1Bn London Listing,"China's national airline is to make its overseas stock market debut with a dual listing in London and Hong Kong, the London Stock Exchange (LSE) has said. Air China plans to raise $1bn (£514m) from the flotation. Share trading will begin on 15 December, the LSE said. For China's aviation authorities, the listing is part of the modernisation of its airline sector to cope with soaring demand for air travel. No further details of the share price or number of shares were given. The LSE has been working hard to woo Chinese companies to choose London, rather than New York for their listings. It opened an Asia-Pacific office in Hong Kong last month. ""We are delighted that Air China has chosen London for its listing outside China,"" said LSE chief executive Clara Furse. ""The London Stock Exchange offers ambitious Chinese companies access to the world's most international equity market combined with high regulatory and corporate governance standards,"" she said. A spokesman for the LSE said: ""We've been engaged with them (Air China) for about 18 months, two years now."" As part of its pitch to bring listings to London, the LSE is thought to be highlighting the extra costs and red-tape imposed by new US laws passed since the Enron scandal, whilst stressing London's strong regulatory environment. Germany's Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder began a three-day visit to Beijing on Monday by signing a deal worth 1bn euros ($1.3bn; £690m) for Airbus to sell 23 new planes to Air China, the Deutsche Welle radio station reported. China's booming economy has created huge demand for air travel among middle-class Chinese, turning the country into a sales battleground between rival plane makers Airbus and Boeing. Air China's long-awaited flotation is part of a strategy to modernise a dozen state-owned carriers, which have been reorganised into three groups under Air China, China Southern and China Eastern. Merrill Lynch are sole bookrunners for Air China's flotation, which will take the form of a share placing with institutional investors in London, though retail investors may be able to buy Air China shares in Hong Kong. Air China's primary listing will be in Hong Kong, with a secondary listing in London. The shares will be denominated in Hong Kong dollars. However, investors may be wary of Chinese stocks. The collapse last week of China Aviation Oil, the Singapore-listed arm of a Chinese jet fuel trader, has cast the spotlight on corporate governance shortcomings at Chinese firms.","China's biggest airline, Air China, is to list shares on the London Stock Exchange in a move expected to raise $1bn (£530m). The state-owned firm plans to sell 20% of its shares, making it the first Chinese airline to list in the UK. Air China is China's second-largest airline after state-owned flag carrier, Air China Group. The company hopes to emulate the success of Chinese computer maker Lenovo, which listed in London in May. Lenovo has surged 50% from its flotation price since its market debut. Air China hopes to raise the money to help repay debts and fund its expansion plans. Beijing-based Air China has been operating for more than half a century and has become one of the biggest names in Chinese aviation. It plans to use about half of any funds raised on paying off short term debts and the rest on expanding its fleet and upgrading its services. The flotation is expected to take place before the end of this year. ""We will use the listing to finance our growth and enhance our international competitiveness,"" said Air China president Li Shihong. ""We believe that listing on the London Stock Exchange will offer us better access to international capital markets,"" he added. Mr Li said that he was optimistic that the company would be able to emulate the success of Lenovo which saw its shares surge on their London market debut. Over recent months, several Chinese companies have listed in London including Oriental Motor Holdings, Minmetals Resources and Shandong Yang"
business,China Bans New Tobacco Factories,"The world's biggest tobacco consumer, China, has said it will not allow any new tobacco factories to be built. China already has more than enough cigarette-making capacity, according to a spokesman for the tobacco industry regulator quoted in China Daily. The ban threatens to reignite tensions between the regulator and British American Tobacco, which plans to become China's first foreign cigarette maker. A spokeswoman for Bat declined to comment on the report. ""China won't allow any new tobacco factories to be built, including joint ventures"", said Xing Wangli, a spokesman for the State Tobacco Administration Monopoly quoted in China Daily. He also said that the state would retain its monopoly on cigarette distribution. China has 350 million smokers who consumer 1.7 trillion cigarettes a year. Smoking is fashionable in China, where it is seen as an essential - and manly - sociable touch for some jobs, such as salesmen. More young, urban woman are taking up smoking too. In July 2004, Bat announced it had won approval for to build a $1.5bn (£800m) joint venture factory in China which would make it the first foreign cigarette maker to manufacture there. The State Tobacco Monopoly Administration said a week later that it had not approved the deal, leading to an embarrassing public row. Bat told the BBC at that time that it had not negotiated with the STMC, and secured approval from ""the highest levels of government"". Since then, the row has flared occasionally, most recently at a forum in November. Bat consistently declines to comment. ""Xing's statement comes as especially bad news for British American Tobacco"", the China Daily newspaper said of the latest development. The Bat spokeswoman said: ""There is nothing for us to add...since our announcement in July last year. The central government of China is the authority that approved our strategic investment."" The decision to ban further tobacco factories does not apply to deals made before 2005, according to the French news agency AFP. The joint venture factory was expected to take till 2006 to build. The Bat spokeswoman would not comment on its progress. However, if the STMA continues to take a tough stance, expansion opportunities could be limited. China's tobacco market is increasingly valuable as anti-smoking campaigners target public smoking in the West. China Daily said the market was currently enjoying steady growth, making more than 210bn yuan ($25.4bn) in pre-tax profits last year, almost double the figure in 2000. The paper made no mention of health concerns. The STMA is trying to restructure the domestic tobacco industry, closing some factories, though such moves can be unpopular with local governments.","China has banned the creation of any new tobacco companies in attempt to curb smoking in the world's largest consumer of cigarettes. Companies are now only allowed to set up factories in provinces where tobacco has already been produced for five years. The move is part of a government campaign to reduce smoking rates, which currently number 300m people. A hundred million Chinese are predicted to die from smoking-related illnesses in the next 50 years. China already limits how many factories and how much leaf-tobacco a company can own. Now all factories must be more than 200km (124 miles) from each other, to prevent companies pooling resources. Already, 45 firms have been told that they have breached the rules on new factories and are facing fines. The China National Tobacco Company (CNTC), which controls nearly 50% of the country's market, is thought likely to suffer most from the new restrictions. The company is rumoured to be planning a merger between two of its subsidiaries that produce cigarettes, in an attempt to keep them under the ownership limit of 20 companies. A spokesman from CNTC told China Daily that the company was still studying the new rules. The changes also mean that existing factories will be allowed to increase their production capacity by 5% each year for the next five years. Currently, there are about 750 tobacco factories in China, with a total capacity of 300m cigarettes a day. China has also closed all smoking rooms on public transport and banned smoking on university campuses. It has also banned television"
business,Glazer Makes New Man Utd Approach,"Malcolm Glazer has made a fresh approach to buy Manchester United, which could lead to a bid valuing the Premiership club at £800m. The US tycoon, who has been wooing the club for the last 12 months, has approached the United board with ""detailed proposals"", it has confirmed. Mr Glazer, who owns the Tampa Bay Buccaneers team, hopes this will lead to a formal bid being accepted. His new offer is expected to contain substantially less debt. Mr Glazer has already had one takeover attempt turned down by the Red Devils and responded by using his 28.1% shareholding to vote off three board members last November. Man United had turned down the bid because it was based on a high level of borrowing. But newspapers have speculated recently that the tycoon had gained the support of leading banks to come up with a stronger and less debt-laden bid. Last week, however, Mr Glazer issued a statement to the Stock Exchange distancing himself from a new bid. Meanwhile, United's chief executive David Gill said in December that talks would not resume unless Glazer came up with ""definitive proposals"". Now the board has confirmed that the US bidder is back, with a statement issued on Sunday reading: ""The board can confirm it has now received a detailed proposal subject to various preconditions which may form the basis of an offer. ""A further announcement will be made in due course."" To succeed Malcolm Glazer will still need the approval of major shareholders John Magnier and JP McManus, who own 28.9% of the club. But the Irish duo have cut off talks with Glazer over the proposed sale of their stake and have so far made no comment on his latest approach. United fans have reacted with anger at the announcement. They have vehemently opposed any proposed takeover by Glazer since he first showed interest in the club in September 2003 and after Sunday's announcement they vowed to fight on. ""We will fight tooth and nail to stop him whatever his offer says. We do not want him or anybody else taking over United,"" said Mark Longden of the Independent Manchester United Supporters' Association. ""The campaign against this proposed takeover will continue as it has done since Glazer first showed interest in the club.""","Manchester United have made a fresh £25m bid for Everton defender Phil Neville. The offer, which could rise to £30m, follows a failed £20m bid last week. Everton have already rejected two offers for the 30-year-old but are braced to lose Neville, who is out of contract at the end of the season. However, the bid may be rejected due to United's insistence on a buy-back clause. Everton are reluctant to allow Neville to leave without some form of compensation. The club have twice rejected offers from United for their captain and have also turned down an approach from Bolton for the England international. ""We hope he will stay,"" said manager David Moyes. ""If he does go, we want something back for him."" Neville has remained tight-lipped about his future although his agent Phil Hughes revealed last week that the defender would not be signing a new contract at Goodison Park. Neville's younger brother Gary has already agreed a new deal with Manchester United and could move to Everton as part of any deal. The 31-year-old midfielder is out of contract in the summer and is yet to decide whether to sign a one-year deal or retire. Everton are also braced for an improved offer from Chelsea for striker James Beattie, with the Blues rejecting a £3m bid last week. The England international has been told he can leave Goodison Park in January after falling out of favour with manager David Moyes. Middlesbrough"
business,Indian Oil Firm Eyes Yukos Assets,"India's biggest oil exploration firm, Oil & Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), says it is in talks to buy the former assets of troubled Russian crude producer Yukos. ""We are in touch with the concerned Russian entities about the Yukos assets and other opportunities in Russia,"" said ONGC chairman Subir Raha. Local press had reported that ONGC was looking to buy 15% of Yukos' former key oil production unit for $2bn (£1bn). Yukos is being broken up by Russian authorities to pay a massive tax bill. It was forced to sell its key production unit Yuganskneftegas (Yugansk) last month after being hit with a bill of $27bn in unpaid taxes and fines. State-owned Rosneft now owns Yugansk and Russia has said it will turn the oil producer into a stand-alone firm. Indian oil minister Mani Shankar Aiyar discussed ONGC's plans during a trip to Moscow last year, and the topic came up again during Russian president Vladimir Putin's recent visit to New Delhi. ""It would make great sense for us to build on that,"" said Mr Aiyar. India's oil production has stagnated over recent years, and it is having to look abroad to secure future supplies. India imports about 70% of its total oil consumption. At the same time, India's economy is booming and the country's thirst for oil is so strong that it has helped pushed up the price of crude worldwide. India produces about 793,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd), little changed since the start of the 1990s, according to oil industry analysts Douglas-Westwood. Consumption, meanwhile, has jumped to 2.4 million bpd, compared with 474,000 bpd in 1973. ""For countries to develop, they have to have access to energy,"" said John Westwood, managing director of oil industry analysts Douglas-Westwood. India is a ""dramatically growing economy that must have access to oil"". By buying into Yugansk, ONGC would be able to reduce its dependence on Gulf states for oil imports, Mr Westwood explained, especially as the chances of finding and exploiting resources within India are slim. ""We forecast that Indian production will go into significant decline,"" Mr Westwood said. ""By 2020, production may only be at half of today's levels."" ONGC, which is majority-owned by the Indian state, already has bought petroleum assets in countries including Vietnam, Sudan and Russia. The company is a partner with Rosneft in the Sakhalin-1 oil field off Russia's Siberian coast. ONGC is, however, not the only firm interested in Yugansk. Chinese crude company China National Petroleum has also been mentioned as a possible investor, while on Thursday, Italy refused to rule out an interest. ONGC's interest is the latest twist in a saga that has seen one of the world's biggest oil producers brought to its knees. The dispute is partly driven by President Putin's clampdown on the political ambitions of ex-Yukos boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is currently in jail on charges of fraud and tax evasion. Yukos has been battling the Russian authorities for more than a year and has filed for bankruptcy protection in the US. Analysts have questioned how long it can continue to survive without Yugansk. On Thursday, a US court said it will hear arguments for Yukos' bankruptcy claim to be thrown out on 16 February. Should that happen, Yukos will have little chance of clawing back its assets, analysts said.","Indian oil company Essar Oil has said it is interested in buying some of the Russian firm Yukos's assets. Essar Oil said it was keen to buy some of the oil firm's refineries and its stake in a Siberian oil field. Yukos is facing bankruptcy because of a $27bn (£13.6bn) tax bill handed down by a Russian court, although the company has appealed against the ruling. Analysts have said there is unlikely to be any interest in Yukos' main assets, including most of its oil production facilities. However, analysts have said that some foreign companies could be interested in buying some of its assets in order to claim ownership as part of any debt deal. ""There are plenty of other companies who might want to buy some of the refineries,"" said Chris Weafer, chief strategist at Troika Dialog. ""There might be plenty of interest around the assets that do not belong to Yukos,"" he added. Essar Oil said it was interested in acquiring some or all of Yukos's stake in the East Siberia-Pacific Ocean (ESPO) oil pipeline and its two refineries - one in Russia and one in India. It also has an option to buy a third refinery - also in India - that is being built by Essar with Russian partner Gazpromneft. ""We would be interested in buying those assets, which are not on the block, with a view of enhancing our downstream presence (in India),"" said Pravin Krishna"
business,Iraqi Voters Turn To Economic Issues,"Beyond the desperate security situation in Iraq lies an economy in tatters. A vicious cycle of unemployment, poor social services and poverty has been made worse by a lack of investment. So there is much hope that an elected government will break the deadlock. ""First rule of law, then the economy,"" says Radwan Hadi, deputy managing director of Aberdeen-based oil and gas consultancy Blackwatch Petroleum Services, which entered Iraq in 2003. Mr Hadi's view about what the new government's priorities should be is shared by many Iraqis. The economy has become the second-most dominant issue for many political parties ahead of Sunday's election, according to Bristol University political scientist Anne Alexander, who is working on a project that looks at governance and security in post-war Iraq. Job creation ranks high both on election manifestos and on the Iraqi people's wish list. Nobody knows exactly how many Iraqis are out of work, but it is clear that the situation is dire. ""Estimates of Iraq's unemployment rate vary, but we estimate it to be between 30-40%,"" the Washington-based independent think-tank The Brookings Institution says in its Iraq Index. But some progress has been made, largely thanks to the country's oil revenues which have exceeded $22bn since June 2003. Iraq's infrastructure is on the mend, with notable improvements having been made in areas such as electricity supply, irrigation, telephone networks and the re-opening of hospitals. But serious problems remain and the growing divide between haves and have-nots is angering voters. One Iraqi woman told Ms Alexander about her frustration as she watched TV adverts for private hospitals soon after having failed to track down basic medicines from Baghdad's pharmacies. Observes Mr Hadi: ""The economy at present marks a big divide; the rich get richer, the poor get poorer."" An indication of this can be seen in the world of finance where, in contrast with the daily plight of ordinary people, 19 private banks operate, only one of which is run in accordance with Islamic banking principles. Hopes are high for the future of finance, so foreign banks have been buying into the sector. National Bank of Kuwait has bought a majority stake in Credit Bank of Iraq, the Jordanian investment bank Export & Finance Bank has bought 49% of National Bank of Iraq. Foreign firms also hope to cash in on the reconstruction effort. Bechtel's efforts to rebuild schools and restore power have attracted controversy as well as boosting its bottom line while Halliburton has enjoyed a wealth of military contracts. But the involvement of foreign firms in the health and banking sectors and beyond sits uneasily with many Iraqis who are accustomed to the state taking responsibility for functions that are essential to making society work, observes Ms Alexander. ""It is seen as a selling off of Iraq's assets and bringing in multinationals at the expense of Iraqi businesses and Iraqi workers,"" she says. Consequently, the transitional government has been forced to backtrack in recent months over its proposal to allow 100% foreign ownership of Iraqi assets, she explains. In the West, it is easy to forget that the otherwise brutal Baathist regime used to look after the majority of Iraq's citizens rather well in terms of job creation, social security and healthcare. Opinion polls suggest that ""people still want the state to take a leading role in providing these things"", Ms Alexander says. Yet in some areas of the economy, investment from abroad is still warmly welcomed, insists Mr Hadi, an Iraqi who left the country three decades ago. ""I think the private sector will evolve incredibly fast,"" Mr Hadi says. ""Iraq's vast natural resources can support any magnitude of economic growth."" Many foreign companies say they are keen to get in on the act, yet few are actually entering the country in any meaningful way. But there are exceptions. Mr Hadi's Blackwatch is just one of many small operators preparing for a much bigger future. Blackwatch's Baghdad-based affiliate Falcon Group has dozens of people working for it across the country in Kirkuk and Baghdad, and its engineers and geo-scientists work with the Iraqi oil ministry to hammer out technology transfer issues, Mr Hadi points out. ""These guys are trying to work. The Iraqi business people will do business at all times. ""Life goes on in Iraq, the people take responsibility, they want to live normal lives.""","Iraqis have been voting in the country's first parliamentary elections since the fall of Saddam Hussein. Despite an improvement in security, the election has been marred by violence and the lack of an accurate electoral register. More than 7,000 polling stations opened at 0500 GMT and were due to close at 1700 GMT. More than 20 million people are eligible to vote in the poll which is seen as a key test of Iraq's post-war political stability. Turnout was reported to be high in some areas as voters - some queuing for more than an hour - cast their ballots. ""I came early because I wanted to do my part in rebuilding my country,"" said Fawzi Kadhim, a retired civil servant, as he emerged from a polling station in central Baghdad. ""I voted for those who will provide services such as electricity and water, and for those who have a history in politics or have fought for our country."" People were also voting in the northern city of Kirkuk, which is ethnically divided between Kurds, Arabs and Turkmen. ""We decided to come here today to vote because we are all brothers,"" said one Turkman voter. ""We support each other, we are brothers and have one heart."" People also voted in the northern city of Mosul - scene of some of the worst violence in the run-up to the election. Many voters could be seen wearing traditional Arab dress as they emerged from polling stations, some holding up purple fingers stained with indelible purple"
business,High Fuel Prices Hit Ba'S Profits,"British Airways has blamed high fuel prices for a 40% drop in profits. Reporting its results for the three months to 31 December 2004, the airline made a pre-tax profit of £75m ($141m) compared with £125m a year earlier. Rod Eddington, BA's chief executive, said the results were ""respectable"" in a third quarter when fuel costs rose by £106m or 47.3%. BA's profits were still better than market expectation of £59m, and it expects a rise in full-year revenues. To help offset the increased price of aviation fuel, BA last year introduced a fuel surcharge for passengers. In October, it increased this from £6 to £10 one-way for all long-haul flights, while the short-haul surcharge was raised from £2.50 to £4 a leg. Yet aviation analyst Mike Powell of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein says BA's estimated annual surcharge revenues - £160m - will still be way short of its additional fuel costs - a predicted extra £250m. Turnover for the quarter was up 4.3% to £1.97bn, further benefiting from a rise in cargo revenue. Looking ahead to its full year results to March 2005, BA warned that yields - average revenues per passenger - were expected to decline as it continues to lower prices in the face of competition from low-cost carriers. However, it said sales would be better than previously forecast. ""For the year to March 2005, the total revenue outlook is slightly better than previous guidance with a 3% to 3.5% improvement anticipated,"" BA chairman Martin Broughton said. BA had previously forecast a 2% to 3% rise in full-year revenue. It also reported on Friday that passenger numbers rose 8.1% in January. Aviation analyst Nick Van den Brul of BNP Paribas described BA's latest quarterly results as ""pretty modest"". ""It is quite good on the revenue side and it shows the impact of fuel surcharges and a positive cargo development, however, operating margins down and cost impact of fuel are very strong,"" he said. Since the 11 September 2001 attacks in the United States, BA has cut 13,000 jobs as part of a major cost-cutting drive. ""Our focus remains on reducing controllable costs and debt whilst continuing to invest in our products,"" Mr Eddington said. ""For example, we have taken delivery of six Airbus A321 aircraft and next month we will start further improvements to our Club World flat beds."" BA's shares closed up four pence at 274.5 pence.","BA has reported an £85m first-quarter loss due to higher fuel costs and a fall in passenger numbers. The loss compares with a £412m profit in the same period last year. The loss was largely due to a £383m hit from higher fuel costs, BA said. Passenger numbers fell 3% in the quarter and average fare prices fell by 6%. But the airline said it had seen an improvement in bookings for spring, which would help lift the second quarter numbers. ""We are pleased that our financial performance has improved from last year's first quarter, when we took a £738m hit from higher fuel costs,"" said Willie Walsh, BA chief executive. ""We expect that the combination of improving bookings and lower fuel costs will see second quarter results improve significantly."" Passenger numbers have been hit by a series of on-board incidents as well as economic slowdown and the Sars virus. The first-quarter results were announced after the London Stock Exchange closed. BA shares closed at 790p before the announcement, up 2.5%. ""The disappointing performance of British Airways is further evidence that there is much less spare capacity in the market than people had hoped for,"" said Richard Marwood, an analyst at Arbuthnot Securities. Mr Walsh said that while passenger numbers were down, they were still at historically high levels. He said the airline's load factor - which measures how full planes are - was still running at more than 80%, compared with an industry average of"
business,Millions 'To Lose Textile Jobs',"Millions of the world's poorest textile trade workers will lose their jobs under new trade rules to be introduced in the new year, a charity has warned. The World Trade Organisation (WTO) is to end its Multi-Fibre Agreement (MFA) on midnight of 31 December. Christian Aid condemned the move, saying it would see almost a million jobs in Bangladesh alone being axed. However, supporters of the change claim it will mean increased efficiency and lower costs for Western consumers. It will also see more jobs created in India and China, advocates argue. The WTO said that many developing countries support the end of quotas and stressed that funding was available to countries such as Bangladesh to help them make the transition to a fully liberalised market. ""There will be a period of adjustment required,"" said WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell. ""Some countries will do better than others but there is no one who is suggesting that no developing country will do well out of this. ""Some countries where it may appear that orders will dry up have seen orders surging and there are many companies who will continue with existing trading relationships."" Christian Aid has called on British firms not to simply ""cut and run"" but look after their workers, in a new report called Rags To Riches To Rags. It added that with few employment alternatives available many sacked garment workers could end up in far worse jobs - with some of the mainly female workers forced into the sex trade. The WTO itself has warned that as many as 27 million jobs could be lost as a result of liberalisation in the textile industry. Some of the world's fastest developing countries which rely on textile exports to build growth - for example in Bangladesh textiles account for almost 85% of the country's exports and the industry employs around 1.5 million people. The MFA pact has helped developing countries get a bigger share of the world market. ""The losers in this new trade landscape will be some of the most vulnerable workers in countries such as Bangladesh, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Nepal,"" Andrew Pendleton, Christian Aid's head of Trade Policy, said. ""They will be hard-pressed to cope when garment industries there lose their protection. ""We are deeply concerned that the New Year will spell misery for huge numbers of garment workers."" The WTO said there was no consenus among its members to retain the quotas and emphasised that funding was available to countries such as Bangladesh to help them adjust to the liberalised market. It added that the impact of the changes for workers most affected by the shake-up had not been considered, adding such seismic changes to policy should ""put the interests of poor people first - rather than simply aiming to liberalise markets at any cost"". While the current MFA was not perfect, its did allow Third World countries like Bangladesh to get onto the first rung of industrial development, Christian Aid said. ""International trade must not be governed by a 'race to the bottom' that pitches one set of poor people against another,"" Mr Pendleton added.","At least two million people in developing countries could lose their jobs by 2010 as a result of more clothes being made in industrialised countries, says a report. The International Labour Organisation (ILO) says the effects of the globalisation of the textile industry will be devastating for workers in poorer countries. It wants international trade rules to be changed to protect workers' rights. But the UK's Self Employed Traders' Association (Seta) warns against changing the rules on free trade. Seta said it was concerned that any new rules could lead to increased tariffs on clothing imports, which would hurt small importers. The ILO report, entitled Globalization, Textiles and the Garment Industry, says two million people in developing countries could lose their jobs because of the ""decent work deficits"" caused by a shift of production to developed countries. The report says: ""The consequences of this relocation, particularly for developing countries, are likely to be devastating for workers. ""The garment industry is widely considered to be one of the most labour-intensive sectors of the economy, offering employment opportunities for large numbers of unskilled and poorly educated workers."" In addition, it said that ""little evidence"" existed that suggested companies which move production from developing countries to richer nations improve conditions for their workers. Instead, it says workers tend to lose benefits such as health care, maternity leave and pensions. Furthermore, it warns that trade rules are not adequate to protect workers' rights. The ILO is calling for the"
business,Qantas Considers Offshore Option,"Australian airline Qantas could transfer as many as 7,000 jobs out of its home country as it seeks to save costs, according to newspaper reports. Chief executive Geoff Dixon was quoted by The Australian newspaper as saying the carrier could no longer afford to remain ""all-Australian"". Unions criticised the possible move - which may affect cabin and maintenance staff - saying Qantas was profitable. More than 90% of the airline's staff are based in Australia. Qantas confirmed it was looking at whether it might recruit and source products overseas - potentially through joint ventures - but said it would continue to create jobs in Australia. Despite making a record Australian dollars 648m ($492m) profit last year, Qantas has argued that it needs to make considerable savings if it is to remain competitive. ""We're going to have to get the lowest cost structure we can and that willmean sourcing things more and more from overseas,"" the newspaper quoted Qantas chief executive Geoff Dixon as saying. Early this year, Qantas increased the number of flight attendants based in London from 370 to 870. If Qantas were to follow the lead of other airlines moving staff 'offshore' 7,000 jobs could shift overseas, the newspaper reported. In a statement, Qantas said it was looking to build its operations overseas. However, it stressed this would not result in large scale redundancies in its home market, where most of its 35,000 staff are employed. ""We are totally committed to continuing to grow jobs in Australia,"" Mr Dixon said. ""We are, however, operating in a global market and there is no room for complacency simply because we are currently profitable and successful."" Unions reacted angrily to the reported disclosure, arguing that Qantas was profitable and did not need to take such action. ""We could understand if Qantas was a struggling airline about to go under,"" Michael Mijatov, international division secretary of the Flight Attendants Association, told Agence France Presse. ""Qantas announced a record profit last year and is on course this year for an even greater profit so it is totally unnecessary."" In an effort to meet the challenge posed by low cost carriers, Qantas sought a tie-up with Air New Zealand last year However, the deal was thrown out by the New Zealand High Court on competition grounds.","Australian airline Qantas is set to announce plans to set up a money-losing leasing subsidiary in the UK later. The move forms part of the company's attempts to cut costs and raise cash through lease deals on its ageing fleet of Boeing 747s. Qantas is expected to use its UK subsidiary to lease back the jumbos, saving millions of dollars in interest payments. The airline has already said it would consider leasing planes in other countries, but analysts are sceptical about any benefits. Qantas has spent about $4bn (£2.4bn) on new planes over the past six years, but deteriorating labour relations and rising costs have hamstrung its finances. In addition, the company has been forced to lease planes from other carriers because its fleet has been too old to meet international safety standards. ""Leasing is one option we're looking at as part of our overall strategy,"" Qantas chief executive Geoff Dixon told the Australian Financial Review on Wednesday, ahead of the official announcement on Thursday. The company was also examining the option of setting up a leasing company in Australia, he said. Qantas has already said it would consider taking money out of its pension fund to shore up its balance sheet, although Mr Dixon stressed this was only one option being considered. Other options include cutting costs further, as well as issuing new shares or debt. Analysts said any benefits from leasing planes were likely to be limited because of restrictions on the amount of debt airlines can take"
business,Us To Probe Airline Travel Chaos,"The US government is to investigate two airlines- US Airways and Delta Air Lines' Comair subsidiary - after travel chaos over the Christmas weekend. Staff calling in sick at US Airways and computer failures at Comair left 30,000 passengers stranded and 10,000 pieces of baggage undelivered. US Airways is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time in two years, and battling to cut costs. It is currently trying to negotiate pay cuts with flight and baggage staff. Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta said he was ""deeply concerned"" at the disruption to passengers, and ordered a thorough investigation. Comair's computer breakdown plunged its flight-crew scheduling system into disarray. Altogether, some 1,100 flights were cancelled over the holiday long weekend. Mr Mineta said it was important to understand ""what happened, why it happened and whether the carriers properly planned for the holiday travel period and responded appropriately to consumer needs in the aftermath"". Adding to the atmosphere of chaos were mountains of luggage left to pile up when a third of US Airways' baggage handling staff called in sick. There was also a shortage of US Airways flight attendants, with nearly a fifth saying they were too sick to work, leading to many flight cancellations. However, union officials denied there had been a deliberate ""sickout"". They said that many people have flu at this time of year and that the airline is chronically understaffed. US Airways ended up cancelling over 100 flights on Christmas Day, stranding passengers in as many as 119 airports. Ground crews at US Airways, the seventh-largest US airline, which is now in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, face a court-imposed pay cut next month. The airline needs to negotiate other paycuts if it is to find a route out of bankruptcy. It is looking for paycuts totalling $800m. ""US Airways has a full-scale employee mutiny on its hands,"" commented Michael Boyd, an industry consultant. Disruptions to flight schedules could discourage customers from flying with US Airways, reducing revenues. US Airways had to cancel approximately 65 flights on Thursday, 180 on Friday, 140 on Saturday, 43 on Sunday and 15 on Monday, said industry officials. The airline said it was ""embarrassed by the situation"" and ""deeply regrets any inconvenience caused to customers,"" The probe will focus on the industry's compliance with a 1999 agreement aimed at improving the quality of passenger service that has so far allowed airlines to avoid congressionally-mandated standards. Analysts said the Christmas chaos cast doubt on US Airway's ability to emerge from bankruptcy - and was likely to worsen the finances of troubled Delta, parent of Comair. Comair ""deeply regrets the inconvenience to all of our customers caused by the severe winter storm in the Ohio River Valley during the busy holiday season, exacerbated by problems with the airline's crew scheduling system, causing additional flight delays and cancellations,"" the Delta subsidiary said in a statement.","A committee of MPs is to hold an inquiry into how the UK's air traffic control system is run. The Transport Select Committee said it was ""unacceptable"" that passengers were still having problems getting to their destinations. The Department for Transport has already ordered a review of the performance of the UK's Air Traffic Control (ATC) centres, following widespread disruption last week. Passengers faced delays and cancellations after technical problems at two UK airports. The select committee's inquiry will focus on how ATC centres are run and regulated. ""The current situation is unacceptable. Passengers deserve better,"" said Louise Ellman, the committee's chairman. ""We need to have a thorough inquiry into the problems at NATS (the National Air Traffic Control Service) and how ATC centres are regulated so that we can be sure that this never happens again."" Last week, hundreds of flights out of London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports were cancelled after technical problems affected both centres. There were also severe delays at other UK airports, including Manchester, Glasgow, Edinburgh and Stansted. A report by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) found that the failure of one computer system at Heathrow led to a ""ripple effect"" in Gatwick's control room and across the rest of the UK's air traffic control system. There were long queues at check-in desks and long delays in taking off because of a backlog of aircraft in the skies above the UK. The CAA is also investigating how easy it"
business,Saab To Build Cadillacs In Sweden,"General Motors, the world's largest car maker, has confirmed that it will build a new medium-sized Cadillac BLS at its loss-making Saab factory in Sweden. The car, unveiled at the Geneva motor show, is intended to compete in the medium-sized luxury car market. It will not be sold in the US, said GM Europe president Carl-Peter Forster. As part of its efforts to make the US marque appeal to European drivers, the car will be the first Cadillac with a diesel engine. GM's announcement should go some way to allay fears of the Saab factory's closure. The factory in Trollhaettan has been at the centre of rumours about GM's planned severe cutbacks in its troubled European operations. But the group's new commitment to the Swedish factory may not be welcomed by the group's Opel workers in Ruesselsheim, Germany. They may now have to face a larger proportion of GM's cuts. Neither will the announcement be seen as unalloyed good news in Sweden, since it reflects Saab's failure to make significant inroads into the lucrative European luxury car market. For years, Saab has consistently said it is competing head-on with BMW, Mercedes and Jaguar. The segment's leaders do not agree. GM's plans to build the American marque in Sweden is part of its efforts to push it as an alternative luxury brand for European drivers. In the US, it has long been established as an upmarket brand - even the presidential limousine carries the badge. Yet it could prove tough for Cadillac to steal market share from the majors in Europe. Other luxury car makers, most notably the Toyota subsidiary Lexus, have enjoyed tremendous success in the US without managing to make significant inroads in Europe. There, German marques Mercedes Benz and BMW have retained their stranglehold on the luxury market. Bringing Cadillac production to Sweden should help introduce desperately-needed scale to the Saab factory, which currently produces fewer than 130,000 cars per year. That is about half of what major car makers consider sufficient numbers for profitable operations, and Saab is losing money fast - albeit with losses halved in 2004 to $200m (£104m; 151m euros) from $500m the previous year. Beyond the 12,000 job cuts announced last year at its European operations, GM is reducing expenditure by building Saabs, Opels - badged as Vauxhalls in the UK - and now Cadillacs on the same framework, and by allowing the different brands to share parts. Another way to further reduce Saab's losses could be to shift some of the production of Saabs to the US, a market where drivers have adopted it as an upmarket European car. Doing so would remove the exposure to the weak US dollar, which is making Saabs more expensive to US consumers. But not everyone in the industry agree that it would be the best way forward. ""We know that in five years the US dollar will be stronger than it is today,"" the chief executive of a leading European car maker told BBC News. The current trend towards US production was ""stupid"", he said. In a separate announcement, GM unveiled a new scheme to allow European consumers the chance to test drive its Opel and Vauxhall models. It is to deploy a fleet of 35,000 test cars across 40 countries, inviting potential buyers to try out a vehicle for 24-hours. It follows a similar initiative by GM in the US. GM said it wanted to change ""customers' perceptions"" about Opel and Vauxhall cars, showing them that the quality had improved in recent years.","Swedish carmaker Saab has announced plans for a joint venture with US carmaker GM to build luxury cars in Sweden. The new firm will be half owned by Saab and half owned by GM, which will provide the technology. Saab has been loss-making since being bought by GM in 2000, but recently returned to profit. The deal will help Saab build its sales and profits, said GM chief Rick Wagoner. ""This partnership with Saab provides an opportunity to strengthen our presence in Sweden, where we have been operating for more than a century,"" he said. The venture will produce a new 9-3 prestige model, which is due out in 2006. ""The decision to produce this important model in Sweden is not only a strong statement of confidence in our Swedish operations, but also an important step in our overall strategy to focus on our world leadership positions in premium cars,"" said Saab chief Jan Ake Samuelson. Saab reported a net profit of 1.1bn kronor ($145m; £78m) for 2003 after making losses of nearly 4bn kronor a year earlier. It is forecast to make another profit this year. The firm employs nearly 6,000 people in Sweden, where it has five plants. Saab's agreement with GM has come under scrutiny from competition authorities, who are looking at whether it has harmed competition. Analysts have said the deal could be beneficial for both companies and also help GM cut its huge debts"
business,Wall Street Cheers Bush Victory,"The US stock market has closed higher in response to George W Bush's victory in the presidential elections. The benchmark Dow Jones share index closed more than 1% higher at 10,137, while the Nasdaq rose 0.9% to 2,004. Many investors believe that Mr Bush's policies are more business-friendly than those of his Democrat challenger, John Kerry. The higher share prices also reflect relief that a clear winner has emerged from what proved to be a tight poll. Investors had worried that the outcome of the poll would be inconclusive, paving the way for a repeat of the legal wrangling that marred the 2000 election. The Dow lost 5% of its value in the three weeks immediately after that election, when it was unclear who would occupy the White House. Mr Kerry conceded defeat on Wednesday, abandoning last-ditch hopes of carrying the vote in the swing state of Ohio. ""The relief for the markets may be that we have a decision and can move forward,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management. Some analysts predicted that the jump in share prices would be short-lived, saying investors would quickly focus once again on the health of the US economy. ""I would look at the stock market rally for Bush as kind of a one-day event,"" said Ken Mayland at Clearview Economics. The US' recent economic performance has been mixed, with solid growth offset by disappointingly low job creation figures, and mounting worries over a record budget deficit. Elsewhere in the financial markets on Wednesday, the dollar dipped slightly against the euro and climbed against the yen, while US oil prices closed up $1.26 at $50.88 a barrel in New York. The rise in oil prices partly reflects the view that President Bush is less likely than Mr Kerry to release supplies from the US' strategic oil reserve. Share prices in London, Frankfurt and Paris also closed higher. Successive polls in the run-up to Tuesday's election had shown the two candidates running neck and neck. Economic issues, as well as the war in Iraq, were the forefront of the campaign. In key swing states such as Ohio, which has suffered substantial job losses in the past four years, President Bush's handling of the economy became a crucial election issue. Senator Kerry attacked President Bush's economic record during his campaign, hammering home the fact that a net 800,000 jobs were lost during his term in office. President Bush focused on the fact that two million jobs have been created in the past year, claiming that it has vindicated his tax-cutting agenda. As for future policies, both candidates pledged to bring America's $422bn federal budget deficit under control. Senator Kerry planned to increase taxes on those earning more than $200,000 a year. President Bush has placed reform of the pensions system at the heart of his economic agenda for a second term. However, economists have said both candidates' economic programmes rested on questionable assumptions about future growth.","The share market in New York has risen strongly as reaction to President Bush's second victory has been positive among investors. The Dow Jones index opened up more than 200 points as traders embraced the news that Mr Bush had won key swing states such as Ohio and Florida. The index closed up 90 points at 10,091.24 but still showed a loss for the day, having fallen steeply in the first few minutes of trading. Analysts said the rise in share prices was partly due to the market's relief that the election had been decided and there would not be further uncertainty. ""Investors are breathing a sigh of relief,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics. ""There is a sense that there will be no more surprises."" The S&P 500 index of 500 leading companies rose 12 points to 1,269. The Nasdaq index of hi-tech companies also rose steadily during the day, finishing up 39 points at 1,913.33. In addition, the dollar rose against other currencies, with one US dollar buying 1.4025 euro, 63.73 Japanese yen, 0.7144 Swiss franc and 1.2541 Canadian dollar. There was also a rise in prices for commodities such as gold and oil, although analysts said this was partly due to speculation rather than any direct impact from the election result. Crude oil for delivery in December rose $1.67 to $48.94 a barrel in morning trading in New York. Gold also"
business,Optimism Remains Over Uk Housing,"The UK property market remains robust despite the recent slowdown, according to mortgage lender Bradford & Bingley and housebuilder George Wimpey. B&B said the buy-to-let market - in which the bank is a major player - would continue to grow much faster than the wider mortgage market. The comments came as it reported a 6% rise in profits to £280.2m ($532m). Wimpey reported a 19% rise in profits to £450.7m and said recent new home reservations were better than expected. Recent housing market surveys have indicated that the UK property market has cooled in recent months after several years of rapid growth. Last week, figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) indicated that the popularity of buy-to-let mortgages - a key phenomenon of the housing boom - could be waning. But B&B - which has a 22% share of the UK buy-to-let mortgage market - said that while rates of growth were moderating, the sector ""continues to grow at a rate considerably above that of the whole mortgage market"". Overall, B&B said that ""housing market fundamentals remain strong"". ""Interest rates and unemployment are both likely to remain at historically low levels, real household incomes should continue to grow and housing demand is likely to outstrip supply into the medium-term."" Despite the upbeat tone, shares in B&B were down more than 4% at 325.5p in morning trade as analysts worried over future earnings growth. Wimpey's profit figures came in at the top of expectations, with the numbers helped by buoyant sales in the US offsetting a slight slowdown in the UK. Wimpey said the UK housing market had proved ""challenging"" last year. ""By late summer, the market in general had slowed sharply across the country and showed no real improvement during the autumn,"" it added. However, the first seven weeks of this year had produced promising signs, Wimpey said. ""Visitor levels and interest in this period have been encouraging and reservations have been at the stronger end of our expectations."" Shares in Wimpey were up 6% at 458.5p in morning trade.","The UK's economic recovery is unlikely to boost demand for housing, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) has warned. Despite signs of a turnaround, Rics said there was a risk that any growth would be driven by consumer spending rather than a need for homes. Meanwhile, a survey by the UK's largest housebuilder Persimmon showed that optimism among homebuyers remained strong in January. The firm said that 3,200 properties were sold in the month, three times the number it sold in January 2004. Rics said that demand for new homes would remain ""fragile"" over the coming months as consumers continued to prioritise other spending and builders struggled with a lack of skilled labour. The group's quarterly survey of 500 chartered surveyors showed that more than half believe that the housing market will not recover until at least the middle of this year. Rics chief economist Alan Kent said: ""There is little evidence to suggest that house prices will begin to rise again any time soon."" But he added that an upturn was ""inevitable"". Rics said that surveyors reported seeing a small increase in enquiries from first-time buyers and existing homeowners looking to move. But Mr Kent said that many builders were unable to meet demand for new homes because they had difficulty in finding skilled labour and there was uncertainty about future building costs. Rics said that the number of planning permissions being sought for new developments fell back in December to its lowest level since August 2003"
business,Euronext 'Poised To Make Lse Bid',"Pan-European group Euronext is poised to launch a bid for the London Stock Exchange, UK media reports say. Last week, the LSE rejected a takeover proposal from German rival Deutsche Boerse - the 530 pence-a-share offer valued the exchange at about £1.35bn. The LSE, which saw its shares rise 25%, said the bid undervalued the business. Euronext - formed after the Brussels, Paris and Amsterdam exchanges merged - is reportedly working with three investment banks on a possible offer. The LSE, Europe's biggest stock market, is a key prize, listing stocks with a total capitalisation of £1.4 trillion. Euronext already has a presence in London due to its 2001 acquisition of London-based options and futures exchange Liffe. Trades on the LSE are cleared via Clearnet, in which Euronext has a quarter stake. Euronext, which also operates an exchange in Lisbon, last week appointed UBS and ABN Amro as additional advisors. It is also working with Morgan Stanley. Despite the rejection of the Deutsche Boerse bid last week, Werner Seifert, chief executive of the Frankfurt-based exchange, may well come back with an improved offer. It has long wanted to link up with London, and the two tried and failed to seal a merger in 2000. Responding to the LSE's rebuff, Deutsche Boerse - whose market capitalisation is more than £3bn - said it believed it could show its proposal offered benefits, and that it still hoped to make a cash bid. Last week the LSE said not only was the bid undervalued, but that it had ""been advised that there can be no assurance that any transaction could be successfully implemented"". However, it has indicated it is open for further talks. Meanwhile, German magazine Der Spiegel said part of Mr Seifert's negotiations with the LSE were about where to base the future board of any merged exchange. While Mr Seifert has suggested a merged company would be run out of London, the mayor of Frankfurt has raised concerns that such a move could cost German jobs. Many analysts believe German Boerse has more financial firepower than Euronext if it came to a bidding war.","Euronext, the pan-European stock exchange operator, is poised to make a formal £1.5bn offer for the London Stock Exchange (LSE), The Financial Times newspaper has reported. The LSE rejected a £1.4bn offer from Euronext in January, saying the bid was ""fundamentally undervalued"". However, the LSE has since agreed a joint venture with NYSE and may have to accept a higher offer from Euronext as part of that deal. Euronext declined to comment on the report. The Amsterdam, Brussels, Paris and Lisbon-based company has also approached the LSE's main shareholders - the UK and Canadian governments - about joining forces, said the Financial Times. The paper said Euronext was expected to submit its revised bid by the end of February. Earlier this month, the LSE said it would set up a joint venture with the NYSE to provide clearing services for sovereign debt in Europe. The move followed talks between the LSE and NYSE, which aimed to create a new pan-European bourse and effectively merge their businesses. The move is seen as an important step in breaking up Europe's four-member exchange monopoly and paving the way for new bourses in Europe. The European Commission has been keen to see more competition in European financial markets, where trading is dominated by exchanges in London, Paris and Frankfurt. If a deal between Euronext and LSE did go ahead it would create Europe's"
business,Telegraph Newspapers Axe 90 Jobs,"The Daily and Sunday Telegraph newspapers are axing 90 journalist jobs - 17% of their editorial staff. The Telegraph Group says the cuts are needed to fund an £150m investment in new printing facilities. Journalists at the firm met on Friday afternoon to discuss how to react to the surprise announcement. The cuts come against a background of fierce competition for readers and sluggish advertising revenues amid competition from online advertising. The National Union of Journalists has called on the management to recall the notice of redundancy by midday on Monday or face a strike ballot. Pearson's Financial Times said last week it was offering voluntary redundancy to about 30 reporters. The National Union of Journalists said it stood strongly behind the journalists and did not rule out a strike. ""Managers have torn up agreed procedures and kicked staff in the teeth by sacking people to pay for printing facilities,"" said Jeremy Dear, NUJ General Secretary. NUJ official Barry Fitzpatrick said the company had ignored the 90-day consultation period required for companies planning more than 10 redundancies. ""They have shown a complete disregard for the consultative rights of our members,"" said Mr Fitzpatrick, who added that the company now planned to observe the consultation procedures. The two Telegraph titles currently employ 521 journalists. Some broadsheet newspapers - especially those which have not moved to a tabloid format - have suffered circulation declines, which are hitting revenues. The Telegraph has announced no plans to go tabloid although both The Independent and The Times have seen circulation rise since shrinking in size. The Guardian is hedging its bets, planning a larger tabloid format like those popular in continental Europe. The Telegraph Group was bought by the Barclay twins - Frederick and David - last year, having previously been owned by Lord Conrad Black's Hollinger International. The brothers are currently mulling the sale of another of their businesses, retailer Littlewoods. Telegraph executive Murdoch MacLennan said the two newspapers would add eight colour pages in the coming months. ""Journalists are the lifeblood of any newspaper, and maintaining the quality of The Daily Telegraph and The Sunday Telegraph for our readers is vital,"" he said. ""However, action to improve our production capability and secure our titles against the competition is also vital."" Many newspapers are investing in new printing machinery that enables them to print more colour pages, or in some cases, have colour on every page. They are hoping that by boosting colour it will make their publications more attractive to advertisers and readers alike. In recent months News Corp's News International unit, which publishes The Sun and the News of the World, the Guardian Media Group, Trinity Mirror and the Daily Mail & General Trust have all announced substantial investments in new printing plants.","Express and Star publisher Trinity Mirror has axed 90 editorial jobs in three regional titles. The company said 60 redundancies had been made at the Shropshire Star, Shrewsbury Chronicle and Telford Chronicle. Earlier this month the group said it would cut 500 jobs in its national titles, including the Daily Mirror. The latest job losses bring the total number of editorial staff to be cut by Trinity Mirror to 640. The company said it had tried to minimise the impact on frontline journalism but added there was no alternative to the ""heavy"" cuts. ""Regrettably, it is inevitable that some of our iconic titles will suffer as a consequence of these changes,"" said group editorial director Richard Hillman. ""Our priority has been to protect them and minimise the impact on local journalism."" Trinity Mirror said the job losses were part of an overall cost-saving programme aimed at reducing costs by £40m a year by 2006. It is also closing its Shropshire offices in Wellington Street, Shrewsbury. The titles affected will be printed from other Trinity Mirror offices from 2 January. The company said there would be a ""significant"" number of new job openings within the Shropshire titles. It added that staff in other regional papers would also be offered job opportunities at the three titles. ""We are committed to maintaining the quality and character of these papers and we will be working with our journalists and communities to ensure that happens,"" added Mr Hillman. ""As publishers"
business,Asia Shares Defy Post-Quake Gloom,"Indonesian, Indian and Hong Kong stock markets reached record highs. Investors seemed to feel that some of the worst-affected areas were so under-developed that the tragedy would have little impact on Asia's listed firms. ""Obviously with a lot of loss of life, a lot of time is needed to clean up the mess, bury the people and find the missing,"" said ABN Amro's Eddie Wong. ""[But] it's not necessarily a really big thing in the economic sense."" India's Bombay Stock Exchange inched slightly above its previous record close on Wednesday. Expectations of strong corporate earnings in 2005 drove the Indonesian stock exchange in Jakarta to a record high on Wednesday. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index may be benefiting in part from the potential for its listed property companies to gain from rebuilding contracts in the tsunami-affected regions of South East Asia. In Sri Lanka, some economists have said that as much as 1% of annual growth may be lost. Sri Lanka's stock market has fallen about 5% since the weekend, but it is still 40% higher than at the start of 2004. Thailand may lose 30bn baht (£398m; $768m) in earnings from tourism over the next three months, according to tourism minister Sontaya Kunplome. In the affected provinces, he expects the loss of tourism revenue to be offset by government reconstruction spending. Thailand intends to spend a similar sum - around 30bn baht - on the rebuilding work. ""It will take until the fourth quarter of next year before tourist visitors in Phuket and five other provinces return to their normal level,"" said Naris Chaiyasoot, director general at the ministry's fiscal policy office. In the Maldives the cost of reconstruction could wipe out economic growth, according to a government spokesman. ""Our nation is in peril here,"" said Ahmed Shaheed, the chief government spokesman. He estimated the economic cost of the disaster at hundreds of millions of dollars. The Maldives has gross domestic product of $660m. ""It won't be surprising if the cost exceeds our GDP,"" he said. ""In the last few years, we made great progress in our standard of living - the United Nations recognised this. Now we see this can disappear in a few days, a few minutes."" Shaheed noted that investment in a single tourist resort - the economic mainstay - could run to $40m. Between 10 and 12 of the 80-odd resorts have been severely damaged, and a similar number have suffered significant damage. However, many experts, including the World Bank, have pointed out that it is still difficult to assess the magnitude of the disaster and its likely economic impact. In part, this is because of its scale, and because delivering aid and recovering the dead remain priorities. ""Calculators will have to wait,"" said an IMF official in a briefing on Wednesday. ""The financial and world community will be turning toward reconstruction efforts and at that point people will begin to have a sense of the financial impact.""","Shares in Asia's two biggest markets defied expectations of a sell-off on Wednesday after a massive earthquake hit south Asia. The Tokyo stock market closed up 0.2% while the benchmark S&P 500 index in New York added 0.28%. The solid performance came despite widespread disruption across south Asia, including the closure of numerous factories in Japan. Analysts had predicted that the disaster would lead investors to sell riskier stocks in favour of safer bonds, hitting the shares of Asian companies hardest. However, markets appeared to shrug off the concerns to focus on the financial cost of the disaster and its impact on growth in Asia. The quake and its aftershocks have killed more than 20,000 people, most in India and Sri Lanka, and left millions homeless. ""The impact of the earthquake may be significant for economic growth in Asia,"" said Yukio Okamoto, chief economist at Daiwa Institute of Research. ""The economic damage will affect consumer spending, which has been one of the major growth drivers during the past couple of years."" Japan's big exporters are expected to take a hit as they face repair bills and lost production while some of their factories remain closed. Analysts said that this should be offset by the boost the repair work provides to consumer spending, supporting the Japanese market. But analysts said that any short-term benefits may be outweighed by longer-term cost concerns. ""There are major issues over how much it will cost to rebuild infrastructure, such as roads and buildings,"""
business,Us Prepares For Hybrid Onslaught,"Sales of hybrid cars in the US are set to double in 2005, research suggests. Research group JD Power estimates sales will hit 200,000 in 2005, despite higher prices and customer scepticism. Carmakers are starting to build hybrid sports utility vehicles (SUVs), the four-wheel-drive vehicles which now dominate the US car market. Hybrids cut both petrol consumption and emissions by combining a petrol engine with an electric motor constantly kept charged by extra engine power. Several jurisdictions, notably the state of California, mandate low emissions for new cars. Equally, the rise in oil prices over the past year has sparked hopes that consumers may be tempted by potential savings of a few hundred dollars a year on fuel. At the Detroit Motor Show, a range of manufacturers are prominently displaying their hybrid credentials. Toyota has led the market to date with the Prius, popularised by a number of celebrities keen to burnish their ""green"" credentials. In April it will launch a hybrid version of its Highlander SUV, with an SUV from its luxury Lexus marque due later in the year. Honda has three hybrids on the market, and between them the two Japanese carmakers sold more than 80,000 units last year. Ford, which has sold 4,000 of its first hybrid since its launch in August, is bringing a hybrid SUV - the Mariner - to market a year ahead of schedule, with plans for three more models by 2008. GM has a hybrid pickup on the market and is showing two concept SUVs in Detroit. Even sports car maker Porsche may join the race, although it insists it is still considering whether to hybridise its Cayenne SUV. Others remain more sceptical. Nissan has bought Toyota's hybrid technology, but plans to bring out its first model only in 2006. ""We want to make sure we are not concentrating on one technology,"" Nissan chief executive Carlos Ghosn said. ""We will not be surprised by any acceleration or deceleration in the hybrid market."" Volkswagen, meanwhile, says it will focus on clean-burning diesel engines instead. And some watchers point out that the price tag on a hybrid - upwards of $3,000 above that of an equivalent normal-engined car, and suspicion of the technology - may still cool its attraction. ""The average consumers aren't willing to pay that premium for a car they won't drive more than six years,"" said Anthony Pratt from JD Power.","British and Irish Lions coach Clive Woodward has warned his players they face a new threat in the shape of South Africa's ""hybrid"" backline. The Springboks' back five can morph into forwards during a match, creating problems for defences. ""They are a hybrid unit who can play like backs or forwards,"" said Woodward. ""They create a unique problem for the defence and it is our job to control them."" South Africa will use their home advantage in the opening Test against the tourists on Saturday. But Woodward is confident his players are ready for the challenge, despite admitting they will have to adapt quickly to the hosts' tactics. ""We have been preparing for this since November,"" said England coach Woodward. ""Our players have faced this kind of system every week in the Six Nations and they have handled it very well."" South African coach Rudolf Straeuli has named an experienced side for Saturday's opening Test at Johannesburg, with Victor Matfield returning after a shoulder injury. But there is no place for inspirational captain John Smit, who is sidelined with a knee injury. And the Springboks' resources will be further stretched when centre Jaque Fourie is expected to be ruled out of the series opener through injury. ""Jaque has been playing well but unfortunately he picked up a slight hamstring injury in training this week,"" said Straeuli. ""We are keeping our fingers crossed that he will be okay for the second Test (in Cape Town). If not, we have"
business,China Suspends 26 Power Projects,"China has ordered a halt to construction work on 26 big power stations, including two at the Three Gorges Dam, on environmental grounds. The move is a surprising one because China is struggling to increase energy supplies for its booming economy. Last year 24 provinces suffered black outs. The State Environmental Protection Agency said the 26 projects had failed to do proper environmental assessments. Topping the list was a controversial dam on the scenic upper Yangtze River. ""Construction of these projects has started without approval of the assessment of their environmental impact... they are typical illegal projects of construction first, approval next,"" said SEPA vice-director Pan Yue, in a statement on the agency's website. Some of the projects may be allowed to start work again with the proper permits, but others would be cancelled, he said. Altogether, the agency ordered 30 projects halted. Other projects included a petrochemicals plant and a port in Fujian. The bulk of the list was made up of new power plants, with some extensions to existing ones. The stoppages would appear to be another step in the central government's battle to control projects licensed by local officials. However, previous crackdowns have tended to focus on projects for which the government argued there was overcapacity, such as steel and cement. The government has encouraged construction of new electricity generating capacity to solve chronic energy shortages which forced many factories onto part-time working last year. In 2004, China increased its generating capacity by 12.6%, or 440,700 megawatts (MW). The biggest single project to be halted was the Xiluodi Dam project, designed to produce 12,600 MW of electricity. It is being built on the Jinshajiang - or 'river of golden sand' as the upper reaches of the Yangtze are known. Second and third on the agency's list were two power stations being built at the $22bn Three Gorges Dam project on the central Yangtze - an underground 4,200 MW power plant and a 100 MW plant. The Three Gorges Dam has proved controversial in China - where more than half a million people have been relocated to make way for it - and abroad. It has drawn criticism from environmental groups and overseas human rights activists. The damming of the Upper Yangtze has also begun to attract criticism from environmentalists in China. In April 2004, central government officials ordered a halt to work on the nearby Nu River, which is part of a United Nations world heritage site, the Three Parallel Rivers site which covers the Yangtze, Mekong and Nu (also known as the Salween), according to the UK-published China Review. That move reportedly followed a protest from the Thai government about the downstream impact of the dams, and a critical documentary made by Chinese journalists. China's energy shortage influenced global prices for oil, coal and shipping last year.","China has halted the approval of 26 planned power plants as part of its efforts to reduce overcapacity in its electricity generation industry. The move affects projects with a total capacity of 25 gigawatts (GW), state-owned power company China Guodian said. The plants were among those ordered to stop work by regulators earlier this month. China has been trying to reduce excess capacity in order to make its industry more efficient and raise prices. Regulators have repeatedly ordered plants to stop work because of the large number of uneconomic plants that have been built. China Guodian said the 26 plants had not yet started construction and would be ""temporarily suspended"". ""The decision is aimed at curbing irrational investment, reducing uneconomic capacity and maintaining the stability of the power market,"" the state-run company said. The move comes after China's five regional grid operators were told by China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) on 4 February to stop work at 26 unapproved projects. The 26 projects together account for about 3 GW of capacity, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs. China Guodian is one of five regional grid operators in China. The NDRC did not name the other four companies involved in the latest move, but earlier reports suggested that some of China's biggest power producers had been affected. Analysts said that the latest move was a further sign that regulators were trying to bring order to China's oversupplied electricity industry. ""We believe this action is only one part of"
business,Aids And Climate Top Davos Agenda,"Climate change and the fight against Aids are leading the list of concerns for the first day of the World Economic Forum in the Swiss resort of Davos. Some 2,000 business and political leaders from around the globe will listen to UK Prime Minister Tony Blair's opening speech on Wednesday. Mr Blair will focus on Africa's development plans and global warming. Earlier in the day came an update on efforts to have 3 million people on anti-Aids drugs by the end of 2005. The World Health Organisation (WHO) said 700,000 people in poor countries were on life-extending drugs - up from 440,000 six months earlier but amounting to only 12% of the 5.8 million who needed them. A $2bn ""funding gap"" still stood in the way of hitting the 2005 target, the WHO said. The themes to be stressed by Mr Blair - whose attendance was announced at the last minute - are those he wants to dominate the UK's chairmanship of the G8 group of industrialised states. Other issues to be discussed at the five-day conference range from China's economic power to Iraq's future after this Sunday's elections. Aside from Mr Blair, more than 20 other world leaders are expected to attend including French President Jacques Chirac - due to speak by video link after bad weather delayed his helicopter - and South African President Thabo Mbeki, whose arrival has been delayed by Ivory Coast peace talks. The Ukraine's new president, Viktor Yushchenko, will also be there - as will newly elected Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas. Showbiz figures will also put in an appearance, from U2 frontman Bono - a well-known campaigner on trade and development issues - to Angelina Jolie, a goodwill campaigner for the UN on refugees. Unlike previous years, protests against the WEF are expected to be muted. Anti-globalisation campaigners have called off a demonstration planned for the weekend. At the same time, about 100,000 people are expected to converge on the Brazilian resort of Porto Alegre for the World Social Forum - the so-called ""anti-Davos"" for campaigners against globalisation, for fair trade, and many other causes. In contrast, the Davos forum is dominated by business issues - from outsourcing to corporate leadership - with bosses of more than a fifth of the world's 500 largest companies scheduled to attend. A survey published on the eve of the conference by PricewaterhouseCoopers said four in ten business leaders were ""very confident"" that their companies would see sales rise in 2005. Asian and American executives, however, were much more confident than their European counterparts. But the political discussions, focusing on Iran, Iraq and China, are likely to dominate media attention.","The world's business and political elite are due to sit down for the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Thursday. This year's summit is expected to focus on the threat of a flu pandemic, globalisation and climate change. More than 2,500 people from more than 100 countries are due to attend, including nearly 200 heads of state or government and 400 chief executives. The four-day event is organised by the Swiss-based forum which was set up in 1971 to improve the quality of international economic cooperation. The theme for this year's meeting is ""mastering the two crises: accelerating growth and improving the world's wellbeing"". In a report released before the meeting, the forum predicted that world growth would rise from 3% in 2004 to 4.3% in 2005 and 4.7% in 2006. It also said that despite recent volatility in financial markets, there were ""glimmers of hope"" for sustained global economic recovery. The forum's chairman, Klaus Schwab, said: ""As we begin 2005, there is an increasing probability that we will see sustained economic growth after more than a decade of 'lost decades' for many countries."" However, he warned that this recovery risked being blown off course unless urgent action was taken on two key issues - energy and climate change. ""Climate change and energy supply are two crises that threaten to block any sustained economic recovery,"" he said. Mr Schwab called for an agreement on greenhouse gas emissions at a"
business,Soaring Oil 'Hits World Economy',"The soaring cost of oil has hit global economic growth, although world's major economies should weather the storm of price rises, according to the OECD. In its latest bi-annual report, the OECD cut its growth predictions for the world's main industrialised regions. US growth would reach 4.4% in 2004, but fall to 3.3% next year from a previous estimate of 3.7%, the OECD said. However, the Paris-based economics think tank said it believed the global economy could still regain momentum. Forecasts for Japanese growth were also scaled back to 4.0% from 4.4% this year and 2.1% from 2.8% in 2005. But the outlook was worst for the 12-member eurozone bloc, with already sluggish growth forecasts slipping to 1.8% from 2.0% this year and 1.9% from 2.4% in 2005, the OECD said. Overall, the report forecast total growth of 3.6% in 2004 for the 30 member countries of the OECD, slipping to 2.9% next year before recovering to 3.1% in 2006. ""There are nonetheless good reasons to believe that despite recent oil price turbulence the world economy will regain momentum in a not-too-distant future,"" said Jean-Philippe Cotis, the OECD's chief economist. The price of crude is about 50% higher than it was at the start of 2004, but down on the record high of $55.67 set in late October. A dip in oil prices and improving jobs prospects would improve consumer confidence and spending, the OECD said. ""The oil shock is not enormous by historical standards - we have seen worse in the seventies. If the oil price does not rise any further, then we think the shock can be absorbed within the next few quarters,"" Vincent Koen, a senior economist with the OECD, told the BBC's World Business Report. ""The recovery that was underway, and has been interrupted a bit by the oil shock this year, would then regain momentum in the course of 2005."" China's booming economy and a ""spectacular comeback"" in Japan - albeit one that has faltered in recent months - would help world economic recovery, the OECD said. ""Supported by strong balance sheets and high profits, the recovery of business investment should continue in North America and start in earnest in Europe,"" it added. However, the report warned: ""It remains to be seen whether continental Europe will play a strong supportive role through a marked upswing of final domestic demand."" The OECD highlighted current depressed household expenditure in Germany and the eurozone's over-reliance on export-led growth.","Oil prices are having a devastating effect on developing economies, the World Bank has warned. In a new report it says that the 50% rise in world oil prices since 2002 is hitting poor countries hardest. The World Bank says that many countries are facing economic crises as a result of the huge rise in the price of oil. It blames the phenomenon on both the oil price hike and flat growth in the global economy. The World Bank's report - The Macroeconomic Impact of Oil Price Shocks - says that the steep rise in oil prices since 2002 has had a ""devastating impact"" on developing economies. ""Oil price shocks seriously hurt growth, incomes and welfare in many developing countries,"" said June Tabor, the author of the report. She added: ""Higher oil prices amplify the adverse impact of other shocks such as financial crises and droughts, leading to deeper recessions and slower growth in many developing countries."" The report says that the impact of these shocks is made worse by a failure to diversify economies away from their reliance on primary resources such as oil. It also highlights what it sees as an insufficiency of global safety nets such as emergency funds, like those introduced after the Asian economic crisis of 1998. The World Bank says that despite repeated warnings, many developing nations have failed to put in place measures to insulate themselves against volatile world commodity prices. It says that governments need to plan ahead for such shocks by keeping bigger reserves and building up stocks of raw materials and food. The"
business,Bank Opts To Leave Rates On Hold,"The Bank of England has left interest rates on hold at 4.75% for a sixth month in a row. The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to take no action amid mixed signals from the economy. But some economists predict a further rise in the cost of borrowing will come later this year. Interest rates rose five times between November 2003 and August 2004 as soaring house prices and buoyant consumer data sparked inflation fears. Bank of England governor Mervyn King has recently warned against placing too much weight on one month's economic data, suggesting the MPC is waiting for a clearer picture to emerge. Economists see next week's inflation report from the MPC as key in assessing whether a further interest rate rise is necessary to keep the economy in check. Slower consumer spending and a quieter housing market are likely to have convinced the MPC that rates should be left unchanged in recent months. Inflation, however, has been rising faster than expected, hitting an annual rate of 1.6% in December - its highest level in six months. Data on Wednesday also showed manufacturing output rose at its fastest rate since May last month, reinforcing a view that economic growth was stronger than forecasts. And recent house surveys from the Halifax and Nationwide have indicated prices are still rising, albeit at a slower pace than in recent years. Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec Securities, said he believed rates would remain at 4.75% for the rest of the year although strong economic data could lead to a further hike. ""The economic landscape has changed quite considerably over the last couple of months, "" he said. ""Growth appears stronger and the MPC may become more concerned about inflation trends."" Howard Archer, economist at Global Insight said the MPC ""may well consider that the balance of risks to the growth and inflation outlook have moved from the downside to the upside"". Business groups welcomed the MPC's widely-expected move to leave rates on hold and cautioned against further rises. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said it was ""concerned by the clamour in some quarters"" for early interest rate increases. ""We believe that these demands should be firmly resisted,"" said David Frost, BCC director general. ""Manufacturing still faces extremely serious problems and is performing poorly, in spite of the recent revised figures."" Ian McCafferty, chief economist at the CBI, said the MPC faced an ""interesting"" challenge. ""Consumers appear to have pulled in their horns over the holiday period, and exporters are struggling with the strength of sterling,"" he said. ""However, the broader economy continues to show healthy growth, and the tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices are nudging inflation higher.""","The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has left interest rates unchanged at 4.5% despite growing pressure to cut borrowing costs. The nine-member panel voted by a majority of six to leave rates unchanged but only three of its members voted to increase rates. The pound fell sharply on the news and was trading at just under $1.60 just after the announcement. Analysts said the MPC had been forced to take into account recent strong economic indicators when making its decision. ""Given that there is little to be gained from further tightening at this stage, some members thought that there was a case for reducing Bank rate by 25 basis points,"" said Adam Posen, a member of the monetary policy committee. ""I think it was the wrong decision."" Analysts said the announcement would help support the UK's economy through the summer months and provide further support to house prices which have seen a recent rebound. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported last week that UK house prices rose 1.6% in July - their first increase since December 2003 - bringing the total rise this year to 1.9%. Halifax reported last week that average UK house prices had risen 5.8% in the 12 months to August, their strongest growth since October 2003. Sterling fell almost a cent against the US dollar following the announcement, from $1.6011 before the decision to $1.5944 just after it was announced. Against the euro, sterling fell from 88.87 p"
entertainment,Outkast Win At Mtv Europe Awards,"US hip-hop duo OutKast have capped a year of award glory with three prizes at the MTV Europe Music Awards in Rome. They won best group, best video and best song for hit Hey Ya! after getting five nominations. R&B singer Usher won best male and best album for Confessions, while UK rock band Muse were named best alternative act and best British artists. OutKast will add their awards to the four they won at the US MTV Awards in August and three Grammys in February. Not only was Hey Ya! one of the biggest global hits of last year, but OutKast have been widely acclaimed as one of the most exciting and innovative acts in music. Their double CD album Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, which saw Andre 3000 and Big Boi each produce one disc, was hailed as the album of 2003 by many critics. Andre 3000 thanked fans ""for supporting OutKast throughout the years"". ""We really appreciate it,"" he said. ""I hope you don't get tired of us, but we only do what we do."" Also competing for best group had been the Beastie Boys, the Black Eyed Peas, D12 and Maroon 5. And Anastacia, Britney Spears, Maroon 5 and Ludacris had been on the shortlist for best song. OutKast did lose out in the contest for best album - which was won by Usher, another award favourite. Usher, who performed a duet with Alicia Keys, also beat off competition from Justin Timberlake, Jay-Z, Nelly and Robbie Williams to take the best male crown. He had four nominations going into the ceremony, with seven artists nominated in three categories. Eminem's group, D12, were surprise winners in the best hip-hop category, beating the Beastie Boys, Jay-Z, Kanye West and Nelly. Eminem told the crowd: ""D12 finally won an award, thank you very much."" The rapper opened the show with a performance of his songs Like Toy Soldiers and Just Lose It, for which he was joined on stage by a crowd of children. The Black Eyed Peas - who had a global hit with Where is the Love? - picked up the prize for best pop act, beating Anastacia, Avril Lavigne, Robbie Williams and Britney Spears. Spears was named best female, sending a message of thanks on video saying the award ""means so much to me"". Alicia Keys, Anastasia, Avril Lavigne and Beyonce Knowles had featured alongside her in that contest. Linkin Park singer Chester Bennington described their prize for best rock band as ""quite an honour"" while Muse said their win for best alternative act was ""a real surprise for us"". Muse were also named best UK and Ireland act, ahead of Franz Ferdinand, Natasha Bedingfield, Jamelia and The Streets. Referring to the fact that winners of 11 of the 12 main awards were from the US, Muse singer Matt Bellamy said: ""There needs to be more European bands."" The 11th annual awards were hosted by hip-hop artist Xzibit and watched by 6,000 people at the Tor Di Valle arena, plus millions more on TV around the world. The ceremony featured performances from the Beastie Boys, who entered the stage on bicycles and skateboards, No Doubt singer Gwen Stefani being lowered from a giant clock and Nelly doing a duet with Pharrell Williams. MTV also organised a huge open-air concert featuring Anastacia and The Cure outside the Italian capital's ancient Colosseum, with some estimates putting the attendance there at 200,000. Last year's big winner at the MTV Europe Awards, held in Edinburgh, Scotland, was Justin Timberlake, who walked away with three trophies.","Outkast took home two prizes at this year's MTV Europe Music Awards in Lisbon. The hip hop duo won best rap act and best video for The Whole World. Britney Spears performed her new single Toxic and also took home three prizes. She won the award for best dance and most wanted female act while her video won best special effects. Madonna also performed her new single Hung Up, which was named best electronic dance music (EDM) song. The former US chart topper took home the prize for best music video at the 2003 MTV Europe Music Awards held in Copenhagen, Denmark. Madonna's song Die Another Day theme tune, which she recorded with Mirwais, also won best soundtrack. The awards, which are voted for by viewers in 25 countries across Europe, were hosted by presenters including Britney Spears herself, Holly Valance and Joss Stone. Madonna said she was ""delighted"" to be back in Portugal, where she performed at the 1995 MTV Europe Music Awards. She added: ""It's good to be back 13 years later and the audience has grown considerably."" The Queen of Pop also revealed she had ""always"" wanted to record a Bond song. ""It was fantastic - I loved it. I hope I get to do it again."" Pop star Robbie Williams also took to the stage in Lisbon to perform his latest hit Feel which is currently number one in the UK charts. He told the crowd: ""It is an honour and a privilege to be here."""
entertainment,Vera Drake Leads Uk Oscar Hopes,"Mike Leigh's film Vera Drake will lead British hopes at this year's Academy Awards after getting three nominations. Imelda Staunton was nominated for best actress for her role in the abortion drama, while Leigh received nods for best director and original screenplay. Kate Winslet was also nominated in the best actress category for her role in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. And Clive Owen and Sophie Okonedo both got nominated for supporting roles in Closer and Hotel Rwanda respectively. Owen has already been made bookmakers' favourite for best supporting actor for the role in Closer that has already clinched him a Golden Globe award. And it is the first nomination for actress Okonedo, chosen for her performance in Hotel Rwanda, about the 1994 Rwandan genocide. It is also a debut nomination for Staunton, 49, who told BBC News 24 she had not thought the film would appeal to Academy voters. ""It was an extraordinary time making the film and I can't believe what has happened this morning,"" she said. ""I hope it just shows Mike up to be the extraordinary filmmaker he is. ""We are also dealing with a very difficult subject matter and it is amazing to have it accepted in this way."" Leigh, who had previously received three Oscar nominations for Secrets and Lies and Topsy Turvy, told BBC News 24 the latest success was ""amazing"". He said: ""We hoped that Imelda Staunton would get a nomination but I never expected to get director and screenplay. It's just absolutely wonderful. ""I think people are aware that it's about life - and I hope it is the warmth and compassion that really talks to people."" Winslet said she was ""ecstatic"" about the fourth nomination of her career. ""Being nominated means so much to me. To be nominated for a film that was released a while ago, I feel so honoured and overwhelmed,"" she said. John Woodward, chief executive of the UK Film Council, said it was ""extremely heartening"" to see British filmmaking talent recognised on the global stage. ""Britain has a hugely talented industry and these nominations show why National Lottery investment in film pays major dividends for our culture and economy."" Among a total of 24 British nominees, composer Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyricist Charles Hart are up for best original song for Learn To Be Lonely, from The Phantom of the Opera movie. Cinematographer John Mathieson, who was nominated for Gladiator in 2001, is also up for The Phantom of the Opera. And Finding Neverland has garnered two more nominations for Brits. Gemma Jackson, who has also worked on Bridget Jones's Diary and Iris, is up for art direction while costume designer Alexandra Byrne, whose previous films have included Captain Corelli's Mandolin and Elizabeth, is in the running. The UK has two contenders in the best live action short film category. Wasp was made by ex-children's TV presenter Andrea Arnold while Little Terrorist is the work of Ashvin Kumar. This year's awards will be handed out in Hollywood on 27 February.","Vera Drake, the true-life drama about a backstreet abortionist, has led the race for Britain's top film honours for most of this year. And the film, written and directed by independent film-maker Mike Leigh, is widely tipped to grab a clutch of Oscars when they are handed out in Hollywood next month. Vera Drake has 11 nominations from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) including best film and director. It is one of two films nominated in all main categories at next month's Oscars. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, directed by Tim Burton, has 10 nominations including best director and best cinematography. But despite its success in Britain there are few expectations that Vera Drake will score any big wins in Hollywood. The film, which stars The Last Emperor's Lily Liu, is not even shortlisted for best foreign language film at the Oscars. And it faces a tough challenge from Pan's Labyrinth, from Mexico, and The Sea Inside, from Spain, for the award for best original screenplay. For its part, The Sea Inside has 13 nominations from Italy's David di Donatello awards including best film. And Pan's Labyrinth has been shortlisted for best foreign language film at this year's Golden Globes. In an unexpected twist, the teenage comedy Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is widely tipped to win best animated film when the Oscar shortlist is announced later this month. But Mike Leigh is favourite to score a victory among his fellow directors"
entertainment,Charity Single For Quake Relief,"Singers including Sir Cliff Richard and Boy George are recording a charity single to help raise funds for victims of the Asian tsunami. They hope the song will raise more than £2m for the relief fund. The song, titled Grief Never Grows Old and described as a melancholy ballad, was written by radio DJ Mike Read. Former Boyzone singer Ronan Keating may also take part if a studio can be found close to where he is holidaying in Switzerland. Other music stars being approached include Robin and Barry Gibb of The Bee Gees, jazz sensation Jamie Cullum, Chris Rea and Olivia Newton-John. Sir Cliff has recorded his vocal part in Barbados, while Boy George has recorded his in New York. Read wrote the song before the Boxing Day tragedy but had thought it was too gloomy to release. Now he plans to have it recorded by a collection of pop stars under the name One World Project. ""It's a natural home for it because people kept saying to me, 'it's such a good song', but it's such a sad song,"" Read said. He said the song was a slow ballad and would work with around 10 singers, rather than a ""sing-along"" like the Band Aid 20 single raising money for famine relief in Africa. The backing track has already been recorded and organisers hope it can be finished within the next week to get it into record shops as soon as possible. Read went to the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC), which is co-ordinating the British relief effort, with the idea the day after Boxing Day. ""I was totally shocked at the enormity and suddenness of the disaster and in tears on seeing the orphaned children wandering aimlessly in search of their parents,"" he said. Read said all the funds raised by the record would go to the DEC. ""I'd only be pleased in terms of what it meant for sales if it got to number one,"" he added. The charity welcomed the news of the single and said money raised would help its agencies working in the affected region to rebuild survivors' lives and livelihoods.","A charity single featuring some of music's biggest names is to be released to raise money for victims of the Asian tsunami. The song, Do They Know It's Christmas, was originally written in 1984 to raise money for famine relief in Ethiopia. Band Aid's original members - including Sir Bob Geldof and Midge Ure - along with other musicians, will record a new version of the song on 4 December. Other stars expected to take part include Coldplay, U2, James Brown and Cara Dillon. The original Do They Know It's Christmas was an international hit, selling three million copies. The new version will be recorded at Sarm Studios in London and producers are expected to approach other artists to take part. The 1985 original of Do They Know It's Christmas was written by Geldof and Midge Ure to raise money for Ethiopia. It featured Bono, Sting, Paul Weller, Cliff Richard and Chris Rea among others, and went on to win a 1985 BRIT Award for best single. The track was re-recorded in 1989 as Where Do They Know It's Christmas, featuring stars such as Elton John, Phil Collins, Paul McCartney and Cliff Richard. All proceeds from the new single will go to the Band Aid Trust, which was set up by Sir Bob Geldof in 1984 and closed in 1994. A spokesman for Band Aid Trust said it was too early to say how much the new record would raise but the original had been ""huge"". """
entertainment,Briton Wins Short Film Oscar,"Three of the five nominees in the live-action short film category at this year's Oscars were British. For Andrea Arnold, who won the category, Ashvin Kumar and Gary McKendry the past month has thrust them from relative obscurity into the limelight. Arnold's gritty drama Wasp is about a single mother living on the breadline, while Kumar's Little Terrorist follows a young Pakistani Muslim boy, who gets stuck on the wrong side of the heavily armed Indian border. McKendry's entry, Everything In This Country Must, forces British soldiers and Catholics to challenge their relationship during the troubles in Northern Ireland. Last week, the trio attended an official screening of all the nominated short films at the Academy's headquarters in Beverly Hills. ""I felt so privileged to have a thousand people watching my film on the biggest screen I've ever seen,"" says Arnold. Set in her native Dartford, Wasp tells the story of a young mum, who, unable to find a babysitter, leaves her four young daughters outside a pub while she's on a date. The image that sparked the film was that of a wasp crawling into a baby's mouth. ""The other nominees said they made their films for this reason or that - they had something to say. But I just start with an image I can't shake off, work outwards from that and see what comes out,"" she explains. Since she presented children's TV shows Number 73 and Motormouth in the 1980s, Arnold has kept a low profile and is having trouble adapting to this sudden onslaught of attention. ""I'm not interested in the publicity. It's not my personality. I'm overwhelmed by all the fuss,"" she said. ""It's all a bit like a beauty contest - all the films are great and so different. ""But even though my film has won 30 awards worldwide (including one at Sundance last month), I'd still be proud of it - even if it hadn't won any."" Asked what the nomination means to her, Arnold says she feels ""flattered and honoured"". ""We've all been overwhelmed by the response and can't get it in perspective yet. I'm still reeling."" And she won't commit to an opinion of Hollywood yet. ""I'm just in the middle of it, living moment to moment, day to day."" But despite her reservations about the Academy Awards and the media frenzy that surrounds it, she accepts that it has opened doors for her. ""People will definitely listen to what I want to do now, and the phone didn't stop ringing for a week after I got nominated."" As for the future, Arnold firmly believes that you often get a stronger vision of the world with short films. ""You're left more to your own devices, without people interfering as much."" That said, she is currently working on a feature film with Dogville and Dancer In The Dark director Lars Von Trier.","A Briton has won an Oscar for best short film, while two others have picked up nominations in the main categories. Chris Heames won the best live action short film award for his film The Sea, about a deaf boy and his father trying to save a fishing boat. Meanwhile, Ed Blumquist and Andrew Bowler picked up nominations for sound editing and sound mixing for The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe. They both worked at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire. Mr Heames, who made The Sea in Cornwall, said he was ""totally thrilled"" to win. ""All you can do is hope that your name is called out,"" he said. ""It's great to be recognised by your peers."" ""I'm looking forward to a shot of tequila,"" he added, speaking on the phone from a bar in Los Angeles. The Sea was nominated against Blindness, Jesus' Donkey, Lambs of God and Water - A Dangerous Film. Mr Heames made the film with producer John Barnes, who runs Storm Studios in Portscatho, Cornwall, where the production was filmed. Mr Barnes said: ""We are absolutely thrilled for Chris and everyone involved in making The Sea. ""It's been an amazing journey and it just goes to show that Cornwall can be at the centre of world-class filmmaking."" The Sea has been shown in 30 countries, including China and Russia, has won 13 awards and has been shortlisted"
entertainment,Surprise Win For Anti-Bush Film,"Michael Moore's anti-Bush documentary Fahrenheit 9/11 has won best film at the US People's Choice Awards, voted for by the US public. Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ won best drama, despite both films being snubbed so far at US film awards in the run-up to February's Oscars. Julia Roberts won her 10th consecutive crown as favourite female movie star. Johnny Depp was favourite male movie star and Renee Zellweger was favourite leading lady at Sunday's awards in LA. Film sequel Shrek 2 took three prizes - voted top animated movie, top film comedy and top sequel. In television categories, Desperate Housewives was named top new drama and Joey, starring former Friends actor Matt LeBlanc, was best new comedy. Long-running shows Will and Grace and CSI: Crime Scene Investigation were named best TV comedy and TV drama respectively. Nominees for the People's Choice Awards were picked by a 6,000-strong Entertainment Weekly magazine panel, and winners were subsequently chosen by 21 million online voters. Fahrenheit 9/11 director Michael Moore dedicated his trophy to soldiers in Iraq. His film was highly critical of President George W Bush and the US-led invasion of Iraq, and Moore was an outspoken Bush critic in the 2004 presidential campaign inwhich Democratic challenger John Kerry lost. ""This country is still all of ours, not right or left or Democrat or Republican,"" Moore told the audience at the ceremony in Pasadena, California. Moore said it was ""an historic occasion"" that the 31-year-old awards ceremony would name a documentary its best film. Unlike many other film-makers, Passion of the Christ director Mel Gibson has vowed not to campaign for an Oscar for his movie. ""To me, really, this is the ultimate goal because one doesn't make work for the elite,"" Gibson said backstage at the event. ""To me, the people have spoken.""","A film attacking the US President's ""war on terror"" has won the prestigious Venice film festival's top prize. Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 beat four other films to win the Golden Lion award at the end of Saturday's ceremony. The documentary, which opened in US cinemas last month, has been criticised by President Bush as ""sick"" and ""distorted"". But the film - produced by a left-wing documentary maker - won more applause than any other at Saturday's ceremony. The film, which is likely to be a major Oscar contender, paints a damning portrait of President Bush and his administration. It examines how President Bush came to win Florida in 2000, the war in Iraq and its aftermath and how he may win re-election in 2004. It has already broken box office records for documentaries, taking $22m in its first weekend. Before going on general release it was shown only in special ""showings"" - often in cinemas with both large and small screens - that campaigners held across the country. In New York, 30,000 people saw it at these special screenings - more than saw it at the Venice and Toronto film festivals combined. The film's producer, Marc Shmuger, said: ""What is clear already is that Michael Moore has created a cultural event."" He added that it had already become part of the election debate and was ""one of the things that is going to help define the presidential election"". The film was shown at the end of"
entertainment,Tautou Film Tops Cesar Prize Nods,"French film A Very Long Engagement has received 12 nominations for France's Cesar film awards, despite a recent ruling it was ""not French enough"". The World War I romantic drama starring Audrey Tautou, was recently ruled ""too American"" by a Paris court as it was partially backed by Warner Bros. But the Cesar organisers modified their rules to allow the film to compete. The film, directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, received best actress, picture and director nominations. Last November a court judged the film was too American to compete in French film festivals. Two associations of French producers challenged Jeunet's right to French government subsidies, because Warner Bros was a backer. The ruling meant the movie - which was filmed in France and used French actors and technicians - was not eligible to compete for French prizes. But Alain Terzian, president of Cesar organisers, the Academie des Arts et Techniques du Cinema, said the changes in eligibility rules, which allow films ""of French expression"", were made three months prior to the court decision. Other films in the best film category include Police drama 36, Quai Des Orfevres, Arnaud Desplechin's Kings And Queen, Abdellatif Kechiche's L'Esquive and France's number one film at the 2004 box-office The Chorus. Best actors are Daniel Auteuil for 36, Mathieu Amalric for Kings And Queen, Gerard Jugnot for The Chorus, Philippe Torreton for L'Equipier and Benoit Poelvoorde for Podium. Tautou will compete against Maggie Cheung , Emmanuelle Devos, Yolande Moreau and Karin Viard for best actress. Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11, The Motorcycle Diaries, Lost in Translation, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and 21 Grams are all vying in the best foreign film prize. The awards ceremony will be held on 26 February. This year, Will Smith, star of I, Robot, Independence Day and Men In Black, will be given an honorary Cesar, along with French singer/actor, Jacques Dutronc.","Camelot, the lavish musical co-produced by Hollywood studio Warner Bros, has dominated the race for France's top film award, the Cesars. The lavish medieval film was named best French film and gained 11 further nominations for Sunday's ceremony. But its director, producer and star, Joel Coen, failed to get any of his three nominations for best director. Instead, Julien Duvivier, Claude Lelouch and Claude Miller got the nod. Miller's film noir Potiche - set in the 1970s and starring Catherine Deneuve - was named best foreign film. It was also nominated in the best supporting actress category. The film's star, Michel Piccoli, was named best actor for his role in Tous les Matins du Monde. Tautou - who shot to fame after starring in 2001 hit The Amelie - picked up the best supporting actress award for her role in Coco Before Chanel. She had been nominated in the best actress category too but lost out to Kristin Scott Thomas for I've Loved You So Long. The Cesars will be held on 11 February at the Chatelet theatre in Paris. Last year's ceremony was hosted by Hollywood star Kevin Spacey, who played Lester ""Worm"" Ratner in hit 1980s movie Swimming Pool.

Geraldine McCaughrean has picked up the children's fiction award for the third time for Not the End of the World. All the category winners go through to compete for the Whitbread Book of the Year title, which carries with it a £25,000 prize. A panel of judges including Sir Trevor McDonald, actor Hugh Grant and writer Joanne Harris will meet up on 25 January to decide the overall winner, with the announcement being made later that evening. Bookmaker William Hill has placed London-based Levy's novel as the 6/4 favourite to win. Small Island, Levy's fourth novel, is set in post-war England and centres on a landlady and her lodgers. One is a Jamaican who joined British troops to fight Hitler but finds life difficult out of uniform when he settles in London. The judges, who included authors Jenny Colgan and Amanda Craig, were full of praise for her writing. ""What could have been a didactic or preachy prospect turns out to hilarious, moving humane and eye-popping. It's hard to think of anybody not enjoying it,"" wrote the judges. The first novel section was won by Susan Fletcher for Eve Green, beating the favourite Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell by Susanna Clarke. Fletcher has recently graduated from graduated from the University of East Anglia creative writing course. Waterstone's fiction writer buyer Suzie Doore said: ""It is great to see Susan Fletcher win in the first novel category. As a relatively unknown author this award will give her exposure to a wider and mass audience that she may not have reached and is a perfect example of the influence of the Whitbread. ""Fresh out of university she is certainly one to watch."" In the biography category it was John Guy's The Life of Mary Queen of Scots that was picked as winner. The judges called it ""an impressive and readable piece of scholarship, which cannot fail but leave the reader moved and intrigued by this most tragic and likeable of queens"". Guy has published many histories, including Tudor England. He is a fellow at Clare College, Cambridge and became a honorary research professor of the University of St Andrews in 2003. Michael Symmons Roberts' fourth collection of poems scooped the poetry award. His works mixes mysticism, erotica and philosophy through life, death and resurrection. As well as writing poetry, Symmons Roberts also makes documentary films. Children's winner McCaughrean, who went into magazine publishing after studying teaching, previously won the Whitbread Prize in 1987 with A Little Lower than Angels and in 1994 with Gold Dust. She has previously been the winner of the Blue Peter Book of the Year.","New Zealand-born author Geraldine McCaughrean has won the Whitbread Children's Book Award for best novel. Geraldine McCaughrean's Whitbread win comes after she was named the first ever Orange Prize winner for women writers of fiction. McCaughrean, who now lives in the UK, won the £5000 prize for her book The Big Lie, set in pre-war Germany. It was selected from a shortlist of six books in the children's category of the two annual prizes. In addition to McCaughrean's historical novel, the shortlist also contained five books written by current children's authors. The award marks a bittersweet week for McCaughrean, who was named as one of the Orange Prize for Fiction's first winners on Monday. But despite being thrilled by her historic win, she said she was ""extremely upset and distressed"" to hear of the death of her friend and fellow author Diana Wynne Jones. ""I am very sad about Diana Wynne Jones dying,"" McCaughrean told BBC News Online. ""We were very close friends and I am still in shock about it all.""

entertainment,Deal To Ban 'Homophobic' Reggae,"The reggae industry is to refuse to release or stage concerts featuring homophobic songs under a global deal struck with gay rights groups. A damaging campaign against stars such as Beenie Man and Sizzla has been waged over lyrics that allegedly call for gay people to be killed or assaulted. The campaign, which led to gigs being scrapped and a UK police investigation, will now be dropped under the truce. Brett Lock of gay group OutRage! said they were ""wiping the slate clean"". The protests had been led by the Stop Murder Music coalition, an umbrella group including OutRage!, the Black Gay Men's Advisory Group and Jamaican movement J-Flag. That coalition has reached a verbal agreement with major dancehall reggae record labels and concert promoters covering eight of the scene's biggest stars. But the artists themselves were not involved in the negotiations and have not directly signed up. Instead, the record companies have pledged not to release or re-release any offensive songs - many of which date back a number of years. And it is believed promoters will make stars agree not to perform such tunes on stage. ""The reggae industry will work with the artists while still maintaining their freedom of speech and artistic freedom,"" according to media and PR strategist Glen Yearwood, who is representing the reggae industry. The industry would halt any attempt by an artist to perform or release a song inciting violence against any group or gender, he said. ""We'll advise them this is not the way forward in a civilised society."" The Stop Murder Music campaign saw protesters picket gigs, resulted in Sizzla's UK tour being cancelled in November, forced Mobo award organisers to drop artists from nominations and saw Beenie Man dropped from an MTV show in August. Police have also been investigating whether lyrics incite the assault and murder of gay people. The campaign was a blow to the reggae industry, Mr Yearwood admitted. ""If you can't have major stars touring, then you don't sell many albums,"" he said. But the artists - Beenie Man, Sizzla, Elephant Man, Buju Banton, Bounty Killer, TOK, Capleton and Vybz Kartel - will not have to apologise for past songs or comments. OutRage!'s Mr Lock said: ""The main players in the dancehall reggae industry will attempt to regulate the industry themselves to ensure that there aren't any violently homophobic or gay-bashing lyrics in the future. ""As a gesture of good faith, the Stop Murder Music coalition has agreed to suspend our aggressive campaigning against murder music. ""So we shall not be picketing concerts or calling for prosecutions to give the industry the space to regulate and reform itself."" Record companies VP and Greensleeves, distributor Jet Star and concert promoters including Jammins and Apollo Entertainment are all on board.","A reggae DJ has agreed to stop producing and selling music that denounces homosexuals. DJ Friction, who produces ""anti-gay"" reggae, has signed an agreement with the Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC). He will stop making ""homophobic"" music, will remove anti-gay lyrics from existing songs and will sell back to the distributor any more anti-gay tracks he makes. DJ Friction's music has been blamed for encouraging homophobic attacks. The EHRC said the deal was a ""landmark agreement"". It said DJ Friction had signed up to a ""code of practice"" governing how he makes and sells music. The EHRC said he agreed to remove all anti-gay lyrics from his existing songs, to not make any more songs that denigrate homosexuals and to sell back to distributor Greensleeves any further anti-gay tracks. ""This landmark agreement is a victory for common sense,"" said Trevor Phillips, chairman of the EHRC. ""We are delighted that Friction has responded positively to our offer of help and put his name to this document."" The EHRC said it had been approached in September by members of the LGBT community - lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender - about DJ Friction's music. It said the tracks had been blamed for encouraging homophobic attacks. As part of its investigation into the claims, the EHRC met Friction and other members of the LGBT community in October.

entertainment,Levy Tipped For Whitbread Prize,"Novelist Andrea Levy is favourite to win the main Whitbread Prize book of the year award, after winning novel of the year with her book Small Island. The book has already won the Orange Prize for fiction, and is now 5/4 favourite for the £25,000 Whitbread. Second favourite is a biography of Mary Queen of Scots, by John Guy. A panel of judges including Sir Trevor McDonald, actor Hugh Grant and writer Joanne Harris will decide the overall winner on Tuesday. The five writers in line for the award won their respective categories - first novel, novel, biography, poetry and children's book - on 6 January. Small Island, Levy's fourth novel, is set in post-war London and centres on a landlady and her lodgers. One is a Jamaican who joined British troops to fight Hitler but finds life difficult out of uniform when he settles in the UK. ""What could have been a didactic or preachy prospect turns out to hilarious, moving humane and eye-popping. It's hard to think of anybody not enjoying it,"" wrote the judges. The judges called Guy's My Heart is My Own: The Life of Mary Queen of Scots ""an impressive and readable piece of scholarship, which cannot fail but leave the reader moved and intrigued by this most tragic and likeable of queens"". Guy has published many histories, including one of Tudor England. He is a fellow at Clare College, Cambridge and became a honorary research professor of the University of St Andrews in 2003. The other contenders include Susan Fletcher for Eve Green, which won the first novel prize. Fletcher has recently graduated from the University of East Anglia's creative writing course. The fourth book in the running is Corpus, Michael Symmons Roberts' fourth collection of poems. As well as writing poetry, Symmons Roberts also makes documentary films. Geraldine McCaughrean is the final contender, having won the children's fiction category for the third time for Not the End of the World. McCaughrean, who went into magazine publishing after studying teaching, previously won the category in 1987 with A Little Lower than Angels and in 1994 with Gold Dust.","Finance director Alan Sugar's right-hand man Erick Levy is favourite to become the new chief executive of Whitbread. The hotel and restaurant group is expected to name its new boss on Monday after chief executive Warren Mitchell quit unexpectedly on Tuesday. Levy, who has worked for Mr Sugar for more than 20 years, refused to comment on the speculation. But a number of bookmakers have him as the odds-on favourite to take over at Whitbread. He is known as an aggressive and hands-on manager and has been tipped for a top FTSE 100 job for some time. He was appointed finance director at Mr Sugar's computer software group Amstrad in 1997 and has also worked as chief financial officer at the group. He is credited with turning around Amstrad's finances, which had been in disarray under former boss Alan Sugar. Mr Levy is also known to have a taste for fine wines and cigars and lives in a £3m mansion in Hampstead, north London. His appointment would be seen as an attempt by Whitbread's board to replicate the success of the turnaround at the company under Mr Mitchell. Mr Mitchell was a surprise choice to become chief executive in 2001 after a series of senior management changes. He had been finance director at Whitbread for four years before taking over from then chairman Richard Debenham. In his first full year as chief executive, Mr Mitchell saw profits double to £84m and was seen as the frontrunner to succeed Richard Carr as chairman when"
entertainment,U2'S Desire To Be Number One,"U2, who have won three prestigious Grammy Awards for their hit Vertigo, are stubbornly clinging to their status as one of the biggest bands in the world. The most popular groups in the history of rock all have several things in common. The music must be inspired and appeal across generations and be distinctive, if not always groundbreaking. But such success is down to more than music. They have to be compelling performers, charismatic and intelligent enough to make good decisions and keep their feet on the ground. They also have to want it. They have to want to be the biggest band ever and not stop wanting it. The Beatles had it, the Rolling Stones still have it, REM hold onto it and Queen were it in a catsuit. And U2 have it in spades, and keep churning it out. Their new album, How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb, comes 28 years after the schoolfriends got together in Dublin and 17 years after The Joshua Tree cemented their place on the all-time rock A-list. They may have lost some of the edginess and raw, youthful force that propelled them to the top, but they have lost none of the desire or ability to craft songs and albums. Vertigo, the first single from the new album, went straight into the UK singles chart at number one, knocking Eminem off the top spot and giving them their 26th top 10 hit. ""The challenge is to be bigger and bolder and better - to make records the whole world will listen to,"" Bono recently said. Drummer Larry Mullen Jr echoed those sentiments: ""We're very competitive - we want to be on the radio, have big singles. We don't want to be thought of as a veteran band."" The band have done ""everything in their considerable powers"" to ensure they remain the biggest band in the world, according to Q magazine editor Paul Rees. ""This makes them hugely determined and formidable."" He added: ""They are equally determined to push themselves to make music that continues to stand up. ""As such, they've constantly re-invented and challenged themselves. They are, perhaps, alone as the only rock band that has got better with age."" The other key ingredient was the fact they were highly organised, Mr Rees said. ""They do everything in the right way."" The group were born when Mullen put an appeal for bandmates on a high school notice board, attracting fellow pupils Paul Hewson (Bono, vocals), Adam Clayton (bass), David Evans (The Edge, guitar) and his brother Dick. Dick Evans soon dropped out and the four-piece were known as The Feedback and The Hype before settling on U2. By 1978, they had won a talent contest and got noticed by a manager, Paul McGuinness. ""They were brilliant, but very coarse,"" McGuinness recently said. ""In a way, they were doing exactly what they do now. Only badly."" They struggled to attract record company attention, later being described as ""pretty damn average"" and ""strange and eerie"" by scouts who saw them live. They released two Ireland-only singles, which topped the national charts in 1979 and 1980, leading to a deal with Island and their debut album Boy. The stadium-filling, anthemic sound was U2's aim from the start, and their third album, War, saw them make the breakthrough on both sides of the Atlantic, going to number one in the UK and 12 in the US. Songs like Sunday Bloody Sunday and New Year's Day brought success and an image as a political and spiritual band - which Bono rejected as a cliche. His stage performances - which included flag-waving, speaker-climbing and drum-throwing - earned him a reputation as an electric performer, and their appearance at 1985's Live Aid is widely seen as sealing their global stardom. In 1987, The Joshua Tree broke sales records and saw the band reach the height of their powers with hits including Where the Streets Have No Name, I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For and With Or Without You. Those songs took the band's epic, atmospheric sound to a simple, powerful and popular pinnacle. The end of the decade marked a crucial point for the band - they had reached the top but still yearned for new challenges and achievements. These came in the form of explorations of different branches of rock and forays into electronic dance music, plus wildly extravagant stage shows, while still trying to retain their mass appeal. The Achtung Baby album in 1991 was followed by Zooropa, Pop and their corresponding stadium tours, which featured giant olives, flying cars, live phone calls to the White House and Bono's transformation into alter-egos The Fly and MacPhisto. He was also building a parallel reputation - not always to the pleasure of his bandmates - as a campaigner on issues from global debt to Aids. Before the release of How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb, they had sold 125 million albums around the world. But they still want more.","U2 have said they want to be the biggest band in the world. Lead singer Bono told Q magazine he wanted the band to become ""the biggest rock and roll group of all time"". ""We want to be the Beatles of our generation,"" added the singer. The band's latest album, How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb, is tipped to be one of the biggest sellers of 2005. Speaking about their new album, Bono said: ""We wanted to be a rock and roll band again, we wanted to be a band again."" He added: ""We've always had this ambition to be the biggest band in the world. We really want to be the biggest rock and roll group of all time."" The Dublin-based band are set to release an EP featuring two tracks from their latest album, including Vertigo which has already topped the UK singles chart. The group's last album, How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb, spent four weeks at number one in the UK chart last December. The record has sold more than one million copies in the UK and more than five million worldwide. U2 are currently on a European tour, with dates in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Italy still to come. The band will return to the UK and Ireland at the end of January for a short tour of indoor venues. Q magazine is on sale now."
entertainment,Jamelia'S Return To The Top,"R&B star Jamelia had three Brit nominations to go with her triple triumph at last year's Mobo awards. The Birmingham-born singer, full name Jamelia Davis, was signed to a record label at the age of 15 and released her first single So High at 18. She released four number ones from her 2000 album Drama, including the top five hit Money featuring the vocals of reggae artist Beenie Man. She racked up five Mobo nominations in 2000, winning one for best video. But in the same year she also fell pregnant and decided to take a break from music to bring up her daughter Teja, who was born in March 2001. While she originally planned to get back to work pretty swiftly after giving birth it was actually two years before she released another single. During her absence R&B music exploded and a whole host of female artists were on the scene, meaning Jamelia had to once again prove herself. Her comeback song Bout featuring Rah Digga only just scrapped into the top 40. It was her next single, Superstar, that really put her back on the map as one of Britain's most popular female R&B singers, holding her own in a music scene dominated by US artists such as Beyonce and Ashanti. Superstar was followed by Thank You, winner of best single at the 2004 Mobos, which reached number two in the UK charts. The autobiographical song, which deals with domestic abuse, hit number one in New Zealand and Australia. Next came the song See It In A Boy's Eyes, which was especially written for her by Coldplay's Chris Martin. His involvement with the song meant not only was it given massive publicity but it was also greeted favourably by a new audience who would not usually listen to R&B. She now combines singing with modelling and supporting charities including the NSPCC and Make Trade Fair. Despite her huge success in recent years, Jamelia remains down-to-earth about her fame and her chances of lasting in the fickle music business, partly due to motherhood. ""When I first got into the industry, I'd be away from home for months at a time. But now I have other things in my life. I still want to make it, but it's not the end of the world if I don't,"" commented Jamelia.","UK rapper Jamelia has climbed back up the chart to become the UK's top female artist. The former De La Soul protegee got her first solo number one earlier this month with 'DJ' and now she has a second top 10 hit with 'Call Me'. The singer is the third most successful female artist this year after Madonna and Kylie Minogue. Jamelia's success bucks the trend in music right now, where female artists are struggling to find an audience. This year has seen the rise of male acts like Justin Timberlake, Usher, Calvin Harris and Robbie Williams, who have dominated the charts. But Jamelia believes it is because women are more likely to be loyal to specific artists. She said: ""When you look at a lot of the new male acts coming through like Justin Timberlake, Usher and Calvin Harris, they are all producing their own music. ""With me, I don't produce my own music but I'm still battling for number one in the charts."" Her theory is backed up by the fact that Kylie Minogue has also had two number ones this year. Pop stars such as Madonna and Britney Spears have also been successful in using their own names as brands in recent years. But despite women doing well in other countries, there has been a drought in the UK. In America, Beyonce has had two hit singles this year while Christina Aguilera is also back on form with a top five hit. And both Madonna and Britney Spears have"
entertainment,Foxx And Swank Take Actors Awards,"Jamie Foxx and Hilary Swank have won the Screen Actors Guild Awards for best male and female film actors, boosting their Oscars hopes this month. Foxx's portrayal of late soul-singer Ray Charles in Ray had already earned him a prestigious Golden Globe award. Swank triumphed for playing a gutsy female boxer in Million Dollar Baby. Modest wine country comedy Sideways knocked out favourites Million Dollar Baby and The Aviator by taking the top prize for best cast performance. The Screen Actors Guild (SAG) represents US film and TV actors. Its winners often go on to win Oscars. In other nominations, Cate Blanchett triumphed as the best supporting actress for her role as Katharine Hepburn in The Aviator. Veteran actor Morgan Freeman took the best supporting actor award for playing a prize-fighter turned gym manager in Million Dollar Baby. ""Thank you for Ray Charles for just living so complex and so interesting, and making us all just come together,"" said Foxx, accepting his award in Los Angeles on Saturday. He also praised the film director: ""Thank you for Taylor Hackford for taking a chance with an African-American film. Taylor, you're my director of the year."" Swank, too, was full of praise for her director and co-star Clint Eastwood. ""I bow down to you,"" Swank said to the 74-year-old Eastwood. ""You are a talent beyond compare. If I'm half the person you are and half the talent you are when I'm 74, I will know that I've accomplished something great."" Both Foxx and Swank are now considered to be among the favourites to get Oscars - the Hollywood's ultimate prize. However, Swank has to overcome a strong challenge from Annette Bening, a nominee for the theatre farce Being Julia. Meanwhile, ballots for Oscars - the Hollywood's top honours - were mailed earlier this week to members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. The voting is due to end on 22 February - five days before the ceremony.","Hollywood stars Jamie Foxx and Hilary Swank have taken home top honours at the 2005 Screen Actors Guild (SAG) awards. Foxx, who was named best male actor at the Golden Globes, beat Leonardo DiCaprio and Joaquin Phoenix to the best male actor prize. Hilary Swank, who won a Golden Globe for best actress, beat Meryl Streep to the SAG award for best female actor. She said she was ""honoured and humbled"" to have her ""work recognised"" by her peers. DiCaprio's The Aviator lost out on best film at the Globes to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind but he did take home a prize for best supporting actor. He beat Clive Owen, Jamie Foxx, Jim Carrey and John C Reilly to the SAG award. ""Seriously, I feel like I've won a Grammy,"" he said as he accepted his award. ""Thank you so much, this is a very exciting moment in my life."" DiCaprio dedicated his award to director Martin Scorsese, who was not at the ceremony and whose film The Aviator did not get nominated at the SAG awards. ""Marty, you're my hero,"" he said.

entertainment,John Peel Replacement Show Begins,"The permanent replacement for late DJ John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show goes on air on Tuesday, with three hosts chosen to fill the legendary presenter's slot. Rock DJ Huw Stephens will go on air in the 2300 slot every Tuesday, with black music champion Ras Kwame on Wednesdays and dance DJ Rob Da Bank on Thursdays. Rob Da Bank filled in after Peel had a heart attack aged 65 in October. All three will play ""diverse, unpredictable and non-commercial"" songs under the banner of the OneMusic show. Radio 1 said the station was not trying to replace Peel, but would rise to the ""challenge"" of ""keeping his legacy alive"" with unpredictable music. The three DJs were chosen for their ""in-depth musical knowledge across a variety of musical genres"", the station said. Rob Da Bank is one of the hosts of The Blue Room, an early morning weekend show which plays electronic and dance music. Huw Stephens has been one half of the Thursday night show Bethan and Huw in Wales, which explores new music, especially up-and-coming acts in Wales. And Ras Kwame is host of 100% Homegrown on Radio 1's digital station 1Xtra, dedicated to showcasing the best hip-hop and garage. Another change to the station line-up will see Sara Cox return after maternity leave. She will host the lunchtime show on Saturdays from this week. Good luck to all three of them, not one DJ could fill Peels boots so it's probably a good idea to get them all contributing. This time next year I hope we are saying how well these DJs have done, but I fear this time next year we will really realise how much John Peel will be forever missed. Very good idea to continue the legacy without attempting to replace John Peel. Also, there will surely be a wider spectrum for international music as three top radio DJs unite under the One World name. Congratulations! The whole glory of John Peel was the fact he was not commited to one genre. He played what he liked across the range of music.... this is not going to be the same, and all they seem to be doing is what they already have. Bring back Steve Lamacq. The obvious heir to John Peel is the marvellous, wonderful and talented Claire Kember from totallyradio.com. This lady is young and fresh and is one of the most knowledgeable and likeable people in British broadcasting today. Everyone who listens to her show understands and compares her to the ledgendary John Peel. BBC Radio should seek out the real talent from internet radio stations, people who are making a real impact on the world of music and the world in general.","A new show featuring the best unsigned bands and artists from the UK music scene is being broadcast on the BBC. The John Peel Show began its second series on Thursday night with a live performance by The Libertines. Other acts featured in the show include Basement Jaxx and The Coral. The first series was presented by Peel, who died in October after suffering a heart attack while on holiday in Peru. Hosted by DJ Mark Richardson, the programme is broadcast on BBC 6 Music every Thursday from 2000 GMT, with a repeat on Saturdays at 2130 GMT. ""I'm only filling John's shoes in a very small way,"" Richardson told the BBC News website ahead of the first programme. ""I hope I do him justice and give a platform to some of the best new music in Britain."" St Helens band The Libertines had been booked to appear on the first series of the programme before it was decided to delay recording due to Peel's illness. Their session on Thursday's show was recorded at London's Orange club. ""It was a great honour to be asked,"" said bass player John Hassall, who was joined by guitarist Pete Doherty and drummer Carl Barat for their live performance. ""We'd been told it would be for Peel's last ever show and so it was very emotional."" Other acts to feature in the new series include The Zutons, The Automatic, The Music and The Thrills. Richardson said he tried to get artists that were ""not only exciting"
entertainment,German Music In A 'Zombie' State,"The German music business - the third largest in the world - is ""in the state of a zombie"" because it has failed to respond to the challenge posed by downloading and piracy, a leading industry figure has said. Tim Renner, the head of Universal Music Germany until last year, told BBC World Service's The Music Biz programme that the country's music industry was now struggling to survive. Renner warned that unless the industry accepted ""new realties"" - such as downloading - its decline could become irreversible. ""The problem the music industry has got is that they aren't willing to accept that the classic way of doing business is over and out,"" he stated. ""So the music industry in its current form over here is pretty much in the state of a zombie."" The music market in Germany peaked in 1997, with sales of 2.6bn euros (£1.8bn). Since 2000, sales have plummeted to just 1.6bn euros (£1.1bn) in 2003. In the space of one year - between 2002 and 2003 - CD album sales fell by 13.8%. But a study by the Society for Consumer Research found that at the same time, more than twice as many recordable CDs had music recorded on them than CD albums were sold. Mr Renner pointed out that, because profit comes mainly from the longevity of a good-selling record, this was particularly damaging. ""You need time,"" he added. However, Peter Zombic, the managing director of the International Federation of Phonographic Industry in Germany, said he did not feel the situation was as ""dramatic"" as Mr Renner believed. ""It's quite true that we have severe problems in Germany - but that's true in other parts of the world and in most developed markets too,"" he argued. ""We have a severe problem with piracy, especially internet piracy, and we also have a severe problem of private copying. ""I don't agree that the music industry lost control over the music market - in fact, especially in regard to Germany talent, the market is quite successful."" He did, however, admit that copyright owners have ""partly lost control of their copyright"", due to piracy and copying. But he refuted suggestions that the industry had been too slow to respond to digital downloading. ""We were the first to implement a download service - back in 1997,"" he argued. ""At that time it was not successful, because of the advent of piracy - it was the Napster time, when P2P services became popular. ""It still is quite difficult for the music industry to compete with a price that is zero as far as the illegal product is concerned."" Mr Zombic also called for a change to the perception in Germany that private copying of music is not a problem. German law does allow people to make copies of CDs for their family and close friends, without fear of breaking copyright. Mr Zombic said that this legal framework was a ""huge problem"". ""There is a widespread attitude that private copying is a hobby, it's nice, it's fun,"" he added. ""We try to make clear it's not nice and it's not fun - it's endangering the creativity in our country.""","German rock and pop music is in a ""zombie"" state, dominated by too many acts who sound all the same, singer Nena has warned. ""It's all about being loud, not about having ideas,"" she said. Nena, who shot to fame in the 1980s with her hit 99 Red Balloons, blamed the ""statutory"" way new acts were presented to the public. She said that too many bands were signed to labels because they fitted a certain look. ""We have to get away from this uniformity,"" she told the news magazine Focus. ""If I were a record company boss, I'd sign no-one,"" she added. Nena - whose real name is Gabriele Kerner - shot to fame in 1982 with her catchy pop song 99 Red Balloons, which was about nuclear war. She followed up the success of the song with two more albums before retiring from music in 1987. She returned to music in 2001 for a short time before finally bowing out again. Nena is now a member of Germany's parliament, the Bundestag, for the opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD). She was elected in 2002. Her comments come as Germany's annual Pop Music Awards (Echo) get under way on Wednesday. The awards are often seen as one of the most important indicators of what will be popular in the coming year. This year's ceremony is being sponsored by Microsoft and MTV Europe - which means it will be broadcast not only"
entertainment,Aviator Wins Top Globes Accolades,"The Aviator has been named best film at the Golden Globe Awards, with its star Leonardo DiCaprio named best actor. Hollywood veteran Clint Eastwood took the best director prize for Million Dollar Baby while its star Hilary Swank was best actress. Quirky comedy Sideways was named best screenplay and best comedy. Ray star Jamie Foxx was best actor in a musical/comedy while Briton Clive Owen and Natalie Portman won prizes for best supporting roles in Closer. The Aviator, in which DiCaprio plays millionaire Howard Hughes, edged ahead of its rivals at the Beverly Hills ceremony by winning the best original score prize. This give it a total of three awards while Million Dollar Baby, Sideways and Closer took two Golden Globes each. Accepting his best dramatic actor prize, DiCaprio described director Martin Scorsese as ""one of the greatest contributors to the world of cinema of all time"". Annette Bening won best actress in a musical/comedy for Being Julia while Spanish movie The Sea Inside was named best foreign language film. Swank, who previously won the Golden Globe and Oscar for Boys Don't Cry, paid tribute to Million Dollar Baby director and co-star Clint Eastwood. ""You guided us so brilliantly, while you also, in my humble opinion, gave the performance of your career,"" she said. Foxx was nominated for three awards but was beaten to the best supporting actor title by Owen and the best actor in a TV movie prize by Geoffrey Rush in The Life and Death of Peter Sellers. A BBC co-production, The Life and Death of Peter Sellers was also named best TV movie. Mick Jagger and Dave Stewart won the best original song award for Old Habits Die Hard from movie re-make Alfie, while Ian McShane was named best actor in a TV drama for his lead role in Deadwood. Other UK hopes Kate Winslet and Imelda Staunton went home empty-handed despite lead actress nominations for Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Vera Drake respectively. Winning a Golden Globe is said to improve a film or performer's chance of subsequently winning an Academy Award. Unlike the Oscars, the Golden Globes split awards by genre - one prize for dramas and the other for musicals and comedies. The Globes also honour the best in television, with suburban series Desperate Housewives named best TV comedy show. Actress Teri Hatcher beat fellow Desperate Housewives stars Marcia Cross and Felicity Huffman to the best comedy actress prize. Hatcher thanked the show's cast, crew and ""a network who gave me a second chance at a career when I couldn't have been a bigger 'has been'"". Cosmetic surgery series Nip/Tuck beat The Sopranos and Deadwood to the best television drama title. Arrested Development star Jason Bateman was named best TV actor in a musical or comedy series. The Golden Globes are awarded by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, comprising film reporters based in Los Angeles and working for overseas outlets. Robin Williams, a five-time Globe winner for such films as The Fisher King and Good Morning, Vietnam, received the Cecil B DeMille award for career achievement.

Leonardo DiCaprio won best actor in a drama for his portrayal of Hughes, while Cate Blanchett won best supporting actress. But Return of the King scored three honours, including best director for Peter Jackson. It also triumphed in the best musical or comedy category, where it beat Sideways and 50 First Dates to the award. British actress Kate Winslet was named best actress in a musical or comedy for her role in The Holiday, while Hugh Jackman took best actor in a musical or comedy for his portrayal of Judy Garland in musical The Boy from Oz. Martin Scorsese won the best director award for The Aviator, beating Return of the King's Peter Jackson and Ang Lee for his film Hulk. The Lord of the Rings trilogy has been nominated for a total of 11 awards at this year's Golden Globes, but failed to add to its tally on Saturday. The film triumphed in the best drama category last year - before going on to win best film at both the Oscars and Baftas. DiCaprio was overcome with emotion as he picked up his first Golden Globe, saying: ""It's an honour to be here tonight."" He thanked Scorsese, ""the only man I could have dreamed of having make"
entertainment,Band Aid 20 Single Storms To No 1,"The new version of the Band Aid song Do They Know It's Christmas? has gone straight in at number one in the UK singles chart. The charity record is also tipped to be this year's Christmas number one. It features vocals from the likes of Chris Martin, Dido, Robbie Williams and the Sugababes. The original version - which was the Christmas number one in 1984 - sold 750,000 copies in its first week and 3.5 million in total. It was released in the US, and reached number 13 in the singles chart. However, Band Aid 20 is not going to be released in the US, despite being sold in many countries around the world. US record shops are stocking an import version of Do They Know It's Christmas, which is said to be selling very well in Los Angeles and New York. British stars who appear on the current recording, such as Dido and Coldplay's Chris Martin, are well known to music fans across the Atlantic, along with U2 frontman Bono. Record company Universal is responsible for the global distribution of the single, which will be available across Europe, Asia, South America and Canada. But music fans in the US are still able to access the song and download it on Band Aid 20's official website. In 1985, a group of high-profile American stars known as USA For Africa came together to record their own fund-raising single, We Are The World. The song was written by Lionel Richie and Michael Jackson, with Quincy Jones as producer. It topped the US charts for three weeks and went on win Grammy awards for best record and song. Dionne Warwick, Diana Ross and Tina Turner were among the line-up of performers. Proceeds from the sales of the Band Aid 20 single will go towards aid relief in Africa, in countries such as Ethiopia and Sudan. The money raised will also be used to help combat HIV and Aids across the continent. The Band Aid Trust which was set up 20 years ago, when the original single was released, handed out $144m (£75m) to famine relief projects across Africa between January 1985 and November 2004.","Band Aid 20's remake of Do They Know It's Christmas? has knocked Crazy by Gnarls Barkley from the top of the UK singles chart. The 1984 original of the charity song sold more than 150,000 copies in its first week on sale, reaching number one despite being available on just one format. The new version sold more than 70,000 copies, with Gnarls Barkley's single selling about 35,000. However, the US songwriters' track will go straight to number one on the UK download chart, where it is on course to sell more than 20,000. Do They Know It's Christmas? was released on Monday as a CD single and a double-pack with a DVD. The vinyl version is not due until Friday, and there is no download version yet. The Band Aid 20 song is also tipped to be the Christmas number one, and would become the first Christmas song to reach the top spot since 1993. The original Do They Know It's Christmas? by Band Aid's line-up of UK and US stars sold more than three million copies within a month of its release. It also topped the charts in 23 countries around the world. Among those who appeared on both versions were Bucks Fizz, Paul Weller and Boy George. In 1984, all proceeds from the single were donated to charity, going towards relief efforts in Ethiopia. This year's money is earmarked for aid agencies combating HIV/Aids in Africa. The new version features such stars as"
entertainment,Fightstar Take To The Stage,"Charlie Simpson took his new band Fightstar to the stage on Friday night, just hours after officially announcing his departure from pop band Busted. He was greeted by a sell-out crowd at the University of Warwick. Confirmation of Busted's long-rumoured split had come earlier in the day, when Simpson held a press conference in London with bandmates Matt Willis and James Bourne. All three band members stressed that the break up was amicable, although Bourne admitted he was ""devastated"" to hear of Simpson's departure. ""This has been a really difficult decision,"" 19-year-old Simpson revealed, ""I hope the fans will understand."" While Simpson declared he would look back with pride on Busted's enormous success, his focus turned immediately to Fightstar, with Friday's press conference coinciding with the start of the band's 13-date tour of the UK. Fuelled by this news, all 1,400 tickets to see Charlie's first post-Busted live appearance - at the University of Warwick's Student Union - sold out rapidly. Mike Eccleshall, the venue's Promotions Coordinator, said: ""Tickets had been selling strongly over the past few days, but sales went mad after the news broke. We had completely sold out by 4pm."" With queues outside the venue long and expectations high, the pressure was on Fightstar to impress. Although many dedicated fans travelled to the gig from around the country, they faced a tough crowd made up chiefly of students, the average age of the audience far exceeding that of any Busted concert. Gone were the screaming girls to which Simpson had become accustomed. Support act Brigade, fronted by Simpson's brother, played a short set first and were met with general approval. When Fightstar eventually took to the stage around 11pm, however, a riotous cheer easily drowned out any hecklers lurking in the crowd. Unfortunately, the band were initially hindered by technical teething problems as Simpson's guitar amplifier failed to work. As sound technicians rushed to fix it, other band members did their best to improvise. When they eventually got under way, Fightstar's blend of emotionally charged rock was warmly received. Far heavier and less commercial than Busted's chart-topping pop-punk, the band will undoubtedly appeal to a more mature fan-base. Warwick student Helen Clutterbuck admitted: ""I came to check out Fightstar because of all the controversy. ""I've never heard them before, but I'm pretty impressed."" Less impressed were fellow students Ryan Crabbe and Gordon Rennie, who observed, ""With Fightstar, Charlie has clearly progressed from Busted's sound, but they're still not very inspiring."" Fightstar played for around 45 minutes, showcasing material from their forthcoming EP called They Liked You Better When You Were Dead, due for release in February.","Punk rock band Fightstar have taken to the stage for their first gig since signing a record deal. Hundreds of fans packed into The Barfly in Camden, London to see the group perform. Singer Charlie Simpson left his previous band Biffy Clyro last year to form Fightstar with his ex-bandmates from his early days in the rock act Late. The quartet's self-titled debut album was released on Monday by SonyBMG. The Barfly gig came less than 24 hours after Fightstar signed a six-album record deal with SonyBMG, and two days before they are due to make their UK TV debut on Top of the Pops. ""It's amazing, this is like a dream come true,"" said drummer Omar Gilbert as he led the band on stage. ""We always thought we'd end up here, it just took a little longer than we thought, so thank you."" The band opened with No Wings to Fly before playing tracks including Hollow Moon and Chasing Shadows, all from their new album. Guitarist Andy Nicholson and bass player Matt Matheson were also part of the original line up of Biffy Clyro before bassist Simon Neil joined the Glasgow three-piece. Drummer Gilbert was part of the short-lived London rock band Late, whose song Get a Life was covered by Simpson for his audition for Biffy Clyro in 2003. In 2004, Simpson quit Biffy Clyro following a US tour to form Fight"
entertainment,Oscar Nominees Lack Pulling Power,"This year's clutch of Oscar nominees have been the least popular for 20 years according to box office figures. In the US the five nominated for best film have been seen by 50% fewer people than movies in previous years. While the awards are not based on box office popularity there is concern for the ratings of the televised ceremony. ""We don't have a Titanic or a Lord of the Rings out there. I think it's fair to say it does concern us a bit,"" said Academy executive director Bruce Davis. About 51 million people in the US have seen this year's nominees, compared with between 100 million and 118 million in recent years. The last time combined attendance was so low was in 1984 when Amadeus beat The Killing Fields, A Passage to India, Places in the Heart and A Soldier's Story to best picture, when 41 million saw the five films. Last year's ceremony attracted the highest audience in four years as viewers tuned in to see Lord of the Ring: Return of the King sweep the board. And the show reaped its biggest audience in 1997 when Titanic took home 11 Oscars. The film had taken $500m (£264m) worldwide before the ceremony, and eventually took $1.8bn (£952m). ""Eyeballs starring at the movie screen translates to eyeballs staring at the TV screen,"" said Paul Dergarabedian of box office tracker Exhibitor Relations. ""People like to have a vested interest in what they're watching. ""When Titanic does $1.8bn in worldwide box office, you've got a lot of people with a vested interest."" Past years have also seen blockbusters such as Saving Private Ryan, Forrest Gump and Ghost compete for Oscars. The biggest box office hitter among this year's nominees is The Aviator, which has taken $90m (£48m) in the US, although takings in the UK have reached only £7m so far. Low-budget move Sideways and Finding Neverland have so far grossed about $45m (£24m) each. The year's biggest blockbusters do actually feature in the Oscar nominees but in the animation category. Shrek 2 and The Incredibles took $436m (£231m) while The Incredibles took $259m (£137m). Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ, which took $370m (£196m) in the US, was largely ignored by Academy voters. But many in the film industry do not equate award and box office success. ""I have never equated the Academy Awards with how much money a movie takes in,"" said Nikki Rocco, head of distribution at Universal which released nominee Ray. ""That's the People's Choice Awards. This is not about the public. This is about the industry bestowing awards on what they think are the best films of the year.""","Hollywood's big Oscar weekend has been and gone, but there's no doubt the Academy Awards have left a void in the movie calendar. Where else can you find a bash with Cate Blanchett, Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio, a red carpet with Madonna and Michael Moore and a party with 50 million TV viewers? The answer is nowhere - because this weekend just gone was the last time they were all together until next year's Academy Awards. And therein lies the problem for this year's eight Oscar-nominated movies. They have had a tough time making an impact at the box office, despite their stellar casts and directors. Films like Million Dollar Baby, Sideways and Finding Neverland have had to rely on critical acclaim to help them stay in cinemas. The hope had been that after months of hype and ceremony, people would flock to see the nominated flicks. But so far, only Martin Scorsese's gritty World War II epic, The Aviator, has been able to claim even a minor hit. It took $23m (£12.5m) in its first weekend after being nominated for nine Oscars including best film, best director and best actor for Leonardo DiCaprio. By comparison, Million Dollar Baby took $14m (£7.7m) in its first three days of release in the US and Canada. The boxing drama eventually took $101m (£53m) in the US after being released in mid-November - good but"
entertainment,Hard Act To Follow For Outkast,"US rap duo OutKast's trio of trophies at the MTV Europe Awards crowns a year of huge success for the band. The latest triumph adds to the three Grammys and four American MTV gongs won earlier in this year. Andre 3000 and Big Boi's album Speakerboxxx/The Love Below has been critically acclaimed since its release and sold in large quantities around the world. The double album - which saw the pair produce one disc each - topped the charts in the US at the same time as single Hey Ya! It took another track from the exponents of southern hip-hop - The Way You Move - to displace it from the top spot. The Georgia pair's year of critical and commercial triumph leaves them with a tough act to follow - what can be next for a musical act that has done it all? G Money, a presenter on the BBC's urban music station 1Xtra, thinks a hiatus is inevitable after such a sustained period of exposure - giving the band time to think about other interests. ""They might be more appearances outside the band, such as producing for other artists, while they have a number of fringe music projects. ""Andre 3000 would like to go into acting, so we might see him a film, while Big Boi already has a dog-breeding business,"" says the DJ. ""But in a couple of years they will be back with another album which will be a collaboration unlike their double CD. ""Their greatness has become clear with Speakerboxxx/The Love Below. We haven't seen the last of them,"" he adds. OutKast's musical career spans 10 years and they have enjoyed commercial and critical success in the past, with their debut Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik going platinum. But it took until 2001 for the pair to score their first hit in the UK with Ms Jackson, while their album Stakonia saw their fame spread beyond the US. 1Xtra's G Money says it took the latest album, released in 2003, for him to be ""assured of their genius"". ""They have always been experimental, some of it has worked and some hasn't,"" he adds. But G Money acknowledges that making the next move for a band that has reached a pinnacle can be tough. ""What can you do next when you've done it all?"" he says. With ten years of success behind them and worldwide fame, it seems that OutKast is not a name that is likely to be forgotten in a hurry.","Rap duo OutKast has won five awards at the 2004 Grammy Awards, including best rap album and best rap performance. The group won most of the top awards in music's biggest night, despite stiff competition from Kanye West and Jamie Foxx. Foxx won four prizes, including record of the year for his hit single Cry Me a River, and rock group Green Day took home three trophies. Eminem, 50 Cent and Avril Lavigne were among the other winners at the ceremony in Los Angeles. West's controversial hit Jesus Walks won him three Grammy nominations at this year's ceremony, but he was shut out. Instead, Foxx picked up best rap song and best rap performance for his gritty remake of the classic song originally performed by Dionne Warwick. OutKast's double CD Speakerboxxx/The Love Below shot to the top of the US album charts shortly after its release last autumn. The duo of AndrA Manuel and Big Boi were previously nominated for six Grammys. They have also won 11 other music awards, including three MTV Video Music Awards. But their victory in the best rap performance category came against tough competition from Eminem, 50 Cent and Ludacris. Eminem took home three Grammy awards last year but was nominated in only one category this time around. As well as winning record of the year for Cry Me a River, Jamie Foxx also picked up best pop vocal album for Unpredictable and best male pop vocal performance for You Decide. Green Day"
entertainment,Oscars Steer Clear Of Controversy,"The Oscars nominations list has left out some of the most controversial films of the past year in favour of safer, less contentious cinema. If best film nominees were drawn on the basis of column inches, two of the front-runners would have had to be Michael Moore's Bush-baiting documentary Fahrenheit 9/11 and Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ. Both films polarised opinion but had critics talking, and the public turning up to see them - Fahrenheit 9/11 breaking US box office records for a documentary, and The Passion of the Christ making more than US$370m (£196m) in the US alone. But this year's Academy Awards have shied away from the big name controversies, with The Passion of the Christ - a film accused of being anti-Semitic - receiving nominations only in the 'minor' categories of cinematography, makeup and musical score. Fahrenheit 9/11 has also been overlooked, despite winning the Palme d'Or at the Cannes International Film Festival in 2004. Moore's caustic documentary may have been affected by its distributors' decision to enter it in the best picture category, rather than best documentary, says Tim Dams, the news editor of trade magazine Screen International. But he also believes the strong political viewpoint of Moore's film does not sit well with the Academy. ""If you look at past Oscar winners and nominees, the very conservative Oscar voters tend to go for very conservative, epic-style pictures. Fahrenheit 9/11 didn't really fit in to that category. ""They tend to go for films like Titanic, Gladiator, and the Lord of the Rings, films with scale that often aren't too contentious,"" he said. While he said the Oscar voting panel were not ""snubbing"" Moore's film, he thought it was unlikely a documentary could ever seriously compete in a best film category. ""I think it's more a misjudgement by the people putting it out rather than a deliberate snub,"" he said. The problem with Mel Gibson's film, he believed, was that the voting panel may have been cautious in nominating a film with dialogue in Aramaic, an ancient Middle Eastern language. ""Hollywood doesn't tend to like foreign-language films - no-one's ever tried doing a film in a dead language,"" he said. But aside from these two films, some potentially contentious pictures have won nominations. The German film The Downfall, a biopic tracing the final days of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler in his Berlin bunker, has been recognised in the best foreign film category. The film has caused some controversy in showing Hitler as a fallible but human man, rather than a semi-mythical, historical monster. But Mr Dams said: ""It's not an inflammatory film. It has done very well in Germany, and it's a film that portrays Hitler as a human rather than some kind of devil or monster."" Another 'contentious' film, Mr Dams said, has gained a nomination in the best documentary section through the force of its charm. Independent film-maker Morgan Spurlock may have forced fast-food giant McDonalds to withdraw its 'super size' portions in the US after he went on a month-long diet eating nothing but McDonalds meals - and filmed his progress. The film has been a hit around the world. Mr Dams said: ""It's a political film, but it's quite fun and punky and well-paced. ""Morgan Spurlock is a really likeable guy. It's a very accessible film, and it doesn't beat you over the head with its views. ""While in Fahrenheit 9/11 there are moments of comedy, I think the way that Super Size Me is put together - the fact it's a very likeable film - means it's won through on charm."" Dam's pick at this year's Oscars? The Aviator, Martin Scorsese's biopic of aviation pioneer and Hollywood player Howard Hughes. Tinseltown, it seems, likes nothing more than a picture about one of its own.","The Oscars are famous for the controversy that swirls around them. But the 2005 Academy Awards are unlikely to be remembered for any upsets or outrageous outbursts. The big surprise of last year's ceremony was the upset win for best picture award for Million Dollar Baby. And there were plenty of other surprises - including the fact that The Aviator did not win a single major gong. The 2004 ceremony was also a showcase for scandal after Michael Moore's anti-Bush documentary, Fahrenheit 9/11, took the best documentary prize. This year's ceremony is unlikely to be so momentous - not least because 2004's ceremony was already one of the most memorable in recent years. The 2005 Oscars can be expected to be more staid and traditional with a few surprises along the way. But it is hard to see how any of the nominated films could suffer an upset at this year's ceremony on 27 February. Films such as Brokeback Mountain, Million Dollar Baby, Ray, Walk The Line, Capote and Good Night, And Good Luck have all had plenty of critical acclaim and strong box office success. And all five of the major categories - best actress, actor, supporting actress, supporting actor and best film - seem certain to go to one of these movies. There have been no rows over any of these films or their stars at this year's ceremony. And there is unlikely to be any controversy over the presentation of awards either. The last time there was any real trouble at the Oscars was"
entertainment,Dance Music Not Dead Says Fatboy,"DJ Norman Cook - aka Fatboy Slim - has said that dance music is not dead, but has admitted it is currently going through a ""fallow patch"". The commercial failure of the latest albums by Britain's two biggest dance acts - Fatboy Slim's Palookaville and The Prodigy's Always Outnumbered Never Outgunned - has been coupled with the closure of many ""superclubs,"" and the folding of three dance music magazines. Last month the Brit Awards announced they would no longer be awarding a Best Dance Act prize, with the Brits committee announcing that ""dance music is no longer where it's happening in music."" These developments lead some to suggest that dance was finished as a popular music genre. Cook acknowledged that much change in the dance world in the four years since his last album, Halfway Between The Gutter And The Stars, but he stressed this did not mean the dance scene was permanently over. ""Every week when I was making the album, I was reading articles about the demise of dance music - and obviously that affects you somewhat,"" he told BBC World Service's The Ticket programme. ""I personally don't believe it's either dead or going to die, but it's going through a bit of a fallow patch. ""So I think, consciously or subconsciously, reading every week that dance music was dead I would think 'right, scrub that track then'."" Although his album sales in the UK are down - Palookaville stayed in the UK top 75 for just three weeks - Cook has achieved recent global success with his beach parties. And event on Brighton sea front in 2002 attracted 250,000, people, while a later one in Rio achieved a crowd of 360,000. The DVD of the Rio set was the biggest seller of that year. ""With a crowd that big, if the weather's nice, the atmosphere before I even go is so good that about halfway through the first record I think 'I've got them',"" Cook said. ""I'm always really really nervous before the big ones - they had to give me Valium before Rio, because two hours before I was literally just pacing the floor. ""For some reason, especially now I've got a reputation for it, the atmosphere and the joie de vivre that's already going on means all I have to do is play 'up' records."" He promised more such parties in more locations around the world - despite problems after the Brighton event, which ended in chaos with many revellers finding themselves stranded as transport ground to a halt. One man also died of a heart attack, and a woman fell to her death during the free party. ""We're having to widen our horizons from just beaches, because there's landlocked countries that want to get involved,"" Cook said. ""We're doing Rio at the carnival, at the Maracana, and Sao Paolo - our new gig is famous football stadiums."" The DJ admitted, however, that his massive worldwide success had a downside, with intense media interest in his personal life. In particular, he said he had struggled to cope with tabloid intrusion during the temporary break-up of his marriage to Radio One presenter Zoe Ball, after she was linked with DJ Dan Peppe. ""The tabloid thing has been difficult at times,"" Cook said. ""Especially the me-and-Zoe-Gate - it's quite scary."" He said that he had been ""determined"" that what had happened with Ball did not affect the album. ""At first I was doing deliberately jolly tunes so that people wouldn't think I was depressed,"" he explained. ""Then I thought, 'that's not right'."" And he highlighted a bizarre coincidence - that one song written before they split had turned out to have a great deal more meaning than intended. ""I said to Zoe, 'I did this track called My Masochistic Baby Went And Left Me, do you mind if it's on the album?'"" he recalled. ""She said, 'yeah, it's hilarious, because your masochistic baby did leave you'."" Cook also added that he had some ways of coping with the intense paparazzi pressure, which accumulates at the end of the private road he lives on - where Paul McCartney is a neighbour. ""It's almost like prisoners rattling the bars with their mugs,"" Cook explained. ""If there's a pap at the end of the road, everyone knocks on each other's doors - Paul comes round, and we warn him, because we don't know who they're after.""","Dance music is not dead, Fatboy Slim has said. Norman Cook told Q magazine he was ""sick to death"" of people saying dance music was over. ""The scene is as vital as it's ever been,"" the DJ said. ""But you'd never know that from the amount of people who say 'dance music is dead'. Well, it's not, you know."" Cook's latest album, Palookaville, entered the UK chart at number six last month. He told Q: ""You have to put it in the context of what dance music really is. It's not those three- or four-minute pop records that are played on the radio."" He continued: ""The media think dance music is what they play on Radio 1. And they think 'Oh, that's going to die'. But they're talking about a very specific thing. And that thing is only a very small part of what dance music really is."" He said there were many records being made for DJs to play in dance clubs and ""they're as good as anything that was ever made"". ""I'm sick to death of people saying 'dance music is dead' - it's just lazy journalism,"" he added. Cook also defended his decision not to appear on Top of the Pops any more. ""I did it for a long time and it just became a job,"" he said. ""I didn't feel like I was putting across what I wanted to do any more"
entertainment,Film Star Fox Behind Theatre Bid,"Leading actor Edward Fox is one of the men behind plans to reopen a Swansea theatre thought to be Wales' oldest. The star of film and TV hits Day of the Jackal and Edward and Mrs Simpson has joined forces with Swansea-born actor-director Terry Palmer. They will set up a charity to raise money to buy the Palace Theatre, and hope to reopen it to audiences in summer 2006. It is estimated that £500,000 is needed to buy the Grade II listed building. The Palace Theatre, which will be known as The Pavilion Repertory Theatre, was sold to an undisclosed bidder at auction 13 months ago for £340,000. Before that it had been used as a nightclub for 10 years. Oscar-winner Sir Anthony Hopkins, who was born in nearby Port Talbot, made his professional debut there, and Charlie Chaplin and Lily Langtry have also trodden its boards. Fox told the South Wales Evening Post that after visiting the theatre he was surprised by its beauty. ""A lot of money needs to be spent on it, but all the bones are there - it just needs a beautiful skin,"" he said. ""To call it a jewel is not an over-estimation. There are not many theatres left like this. ""The hope for the immediate future is that we can attract enough people to come forward to allow it to prosper,"" he told the newspaper. Fox first found fame in the 1960s. One of his most memorable roles was as an assassin in the Day of the Jackal in 1973, and he won a TV Bafta as the Prince of Wales in 1980 for Edward and Mrs Simpson. He was brought on board to save the theatre by Mr Palmer, a long-standing friend of 40 years. ""Two years ago I decided to return to Swansea and do something for the city,"" said Mr Palmer. He said he was excited by the idea of running the Palace as a charity where young actors could develop, and with an annual Shakespeare festival in the summer. ""If in five years' time the theatre can function in all areas without me, I shall be well satisfied having helped to create a vital living theatre for the city,"" he added. Keith Poulton, a business adviser from Swansea, has already committed an undisclosed amount of money to the project. ""We need at least £75,000 to secure a deposit on the building and we've only got two months to do that,"" said Mr Poulton. ""A few benefactors have expressed their interest and Mr Fox is going to give it an awful lot of time,"" he added. Last year, roads around the theatre were cordoned off when masonry from its roof fell onto a car, but engineers said they were happy that it was safe.","Film star Michael Caine is backing a bid to buy London's historic Donmar Warehouse theatre. The Oscar-nominated actor is part of a group which has made an offer to buy the venue from its current owners, the three founding directors. The 75-year-old actor, who has appeared in more than 70 films including Get Carter, Alfie and The Cider House Rules, has pledged £1m towards the £8.5m asking price. He said the Donmar was one of London's ""unique"" theatres. ""It is a remarkable theatre which has nurtured some of our country's finest talents,"" Mr Caine said. He added: ""The vision that Sam Mendes, Josie Rourke and Ed Rubin have for the Donmar is one I share and I hope that my support will make a difference."" The theatre on King Street in central London was set up by Sam Mendes, Josie Rourke and Ed Rubin in 1994. In 2000 they handed over control to an independent charitable trust, but have retained ownership of the building. They are planning to turn the 500-seat venue into a studio for new work, but say they hope it will continue to be used as a theatre. Ms Rourke said: ""It's wonderful to have Michael's support as he is one of the few actors active today who can match the quality and dedication of the Donmar's early supporters.""

entertainment,Bening Makes Awards Breakthrough,"Film actress Annette Bening is up for an Oscar for her starring role in the award-winning film Being Julia. Bening, who was born in Texas in 1958, has gained prominence for a string of key roles. Although an Oscar has so far eluded her, her status as one of Hollywood's favourite actresses remains solid. One of the biggest Oscars buzzes in recent years was for Bening's role as troubled Carolyn Burnham in 1999's American Beauty. But her deliciously neurotic portrayal of surburban life turning sour was overlooked in favour of Hilary Swank's leading role in Boys Don't Cry. After opening her career in the theatre - and gaining a Tony Award nomination in 1986 - Bening had a low-key spell in television. She then made her film debut as a sex-starved wife in 1988's The Great Outdoors, opposite comics Dan Akroyd and John Candy. Following a cameo in Postcards From The Edge, Bening's breakthrough role came in 1990, playing seductive con artist Myra Langtry in The Grifters - a role that won her an Oscar nomination. Despite some rave reviews, Bening did not win the best supporting actress Academy Award. However the high-profile performance enabled Bening to capture roles in a number of big budget Hollywood productions, co-starring with some of Hollywood's greatest players, including Robert De Niro and Harrison Ford. But it was her role opposite Warren Beatty in 1991 gangster flick Bugsy which had the greatest impact. Bening played Virginia Hill, another role which won her high critical acclaim, but the film only picked up two of a staggering 12 Oscar nominations. Bugsy was the start of a very significant liaison for Bening - she married Beatty, with whom she had a child as the couple promoted the film in Europe. The couple now have four children together. A pair of contrasting yet successful performances peppered Bening's career in the mid-1990s. She played Michael Douglas' opposite number in romantic comedy The American President, and as a ""fiery"" Queen Elizabeth I in a contemporary adaptation of Shakespeare's Richard III. Bening was the first choice to play the female lead in American Beauty, director Sam Mendes' film debut which was a critical and commercial success - but the actress had to be content with a Bafta award for her strong performance. But current film Being Julia has made Bening an award-winning actress rather than the perennial nominee, with success at the Golden Globes. The witty tale of revenge and love set in 1930s London sees the eponymous theatrical diva - played by Bening - grow tired of her success and fall for a young American - and could be the role which finally wins her the coveted Academy Award.","Hollywood actress Angela Bassett has become the first black woman to win a best actress Oscar, for her role in Hustle & Flow. She beat actresses Holly Hunter and Frances McDormand to the best supporting actress award at the 2005 Academy Awards. Bassett, who was also nominated for her role in What's Love Got To Do With It, thanked her ""wonderful white parents"" and said she hoped she would inspire black children to dream. ""I want to say to all the little black children that you can be anything you want to be,"" she said. ""I want to thank the Hollywood community for allowing me to be a part of their wonderful and talented group."" The Oscars ceremony was held at the Kodak Theatre in Los Angeles, hosted by comedian Chris Rock. Hosting a major US awards show has proved a tricky task for Rock in previous years, with critics saying his hosting of the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards was over-the-top. This year he promised to tone down his act and deliver a ""more dignified"" ceremony. He also promised to tell more jokes about President Bush and the Iraq war, after he was warned off the subject by the Academy Awards producers. Earlier this week Rock told reporters: ""They were like 'Chris, if you talk about Bush or Iraq, we're going to pull you out of there'."" He added: ""I wanted to get some laughs and I thought that was my job."" The decision over whether or not to go ahead"
entertainment,Lasting Influence Of Legend Charles,"Ray Charles, who has won a string of posthumous Grammy Awards, belonged to a pioneering generation of artists that had a huge influence on the course of rock and pop music. His sound encompassed so many styles - blues, gospel, jazz, rock 'n' roll, even country - and had a real impact on the nascent UK beat and R&B scenes. Compared in stature to Elvis Presley by some commentators, Charles' songs cast their spell on such 1960s stalwarts as Joe Cocker, Steve Winwood, Eric Burdon and Van Morrison. His influence has extended to contemporary artists such as Norah Jones, with whom he recently recorded a duet. If James Brown was the godfather of soul, then Ray Charles was indisputably one of its founding fathers. Along with Sam Cooke, he was instrumental in bringing together the gospel fervour of the deep south Baptist church with the ""devil's"" music of R&B to pave the way for a new generation of soul artists. Without Charles, it is hard to imagine the tear-stained Atlantic R&B sound of Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding or Wilson Pickett. He was also a talented jazz composer, arranger and band leader, playing at the Newport Jazz Festival and Carnegie Hall and recording with noted jazz musicians such as Milt Jackson and David ""Fathead"" Newman. Unfortunately, he also shared another trait common among many jazz artists of the era - that of heroin addiction, which led to him being arrested in 1965. His string of 1950s Atlantic R&B successes included songs that would be covered by the first-generation rock 'n' roll greats, including I've Got A Woman (Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley) and Hallelujah, I Love Her So (Eddie Cochran). After the exuberance of his 1959 signature song What'd I Say, Charles turned towards a more pop-oriented style, recording Hoagy Carmichael's sentimental string ballad Georgia On My Mind, and the upbeat Hit The Road Jack. He also won acclaim in the country arena with his interpretations of Hank Williams standards such as Your Cheating Heart and You Win Again. More than 40 years after its release, his 1962 ABC album Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music is still regarded as a classic. His version of Don Gibson's I Can't Stop Loving You topped the pop and R&B charts in the US. In 1972, he made a rare foray into protest songs with his album A Message from the People. On it, he took a stand on poverty and civil rights - echoing similar recordings of the era from progeny such as Stevie Wonder, James Brown, Curtis Mayfield and Marvin Gaye. More than 20 years later, he would embrace contemporary production with his 1993 album My World, which featured hip-hop beats - although Charles claimed at the time not to know what hip-hop was. Among the tributes that poured in from all sections of the music world when Charles died aged 73 in June 2004 was one from his friend, the producer Quincy Jones, who described him as a ""brother in every sense of the word"". ""There will never be another musician who did as much to break down the perceived walls of musical genres as much as Ray Charles did,"" he said. Former Manfred Mann singer Paul Jones, who sang on 1960s hits such as Come Tomorrow and Sha La La, said Charles was one of his heroes. ""I'm quite sure my own writing was influenced by him,"" he told BBC News Online. ""I would put money on the proposition that Ray Charles will have an influence on music forever.""","Rugby union has lost one of its greatest players and people in Charles 'Chuckles' Chesterton, who died on Wednesday aged 50. He played 51 times for the England team, scored nine tries and captained his country. But he will be remembered, as he would have wished, for his colourful personality, his love of life and his generous spirit. His enthusiasm for rugby was matched by his enthusiasm for life in general. He was an entertainer - both on and off the pitch - and a man who enjoyed the company of others. His ability to win people over with his gigantic personality has had a lasting influence on the game. He made his name as a wing-forward for Rosslyn Park in the mid-1970s, and went on to captain England, before joining Gloucester and becoming player-coach. He took over as Gloucester coach after Phil Orr's departure in 1983, and introduced training sessions with music playing and what he called ""non-rugby"" games. His philosophy was that players should have fun while they were playing, and he got spectacular results with Gloucester winning the cup in 1985. He moved on to become England coach and took charge of the side which won the Five Nations' Championship in 1990. Under his leadership England beat Australia, which was something that had not been achieved since 1971. He also coached the British Lions in New Zealand in 1993. He continued to work in rugby as an occasional referee and always saw himself primarily as a coach"
entertainment,Uk 'World'S Biggest Music Buyer',"UK consumers are the biggest music buyers in the world, according to new figures released on Tuesday by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). But global sales of recorded music were flat in 2004, with growing sales in DVD music videos offset by online and physical piracy in major markets. The UK music industry recorded an overall 3% increase in volume sales, mostly due to its robust albums market. However, world music sales declined by 1.3% to $33.6 billion (£17.7 billion). The UK CD albums market grew by 4.5% in 2004 with a record 174.6 million units sold. On average every Briton buys 3.2 CDs per person per year. Around 26,000 albums are released in the UK each year, making Britain second only to the US in terms of the number of releases. Overall sales were driven by new UK-signed artists such as Keane, Katie Melua and Scissor Sisters, whose debut album sold almost 1.6 million copies in the UK. ""A slew of great new British artists have met UK music fans' demand for great music,"" said BPI chairman Peter Jameson. The best-selling album globally was Usher's Confessions - one of eight albums to sell more than five million copies in 2004. The growth in the DVD market and a sharp increase in sales of digital music ensured a strong market in the US. The total number of tracks downloaded last year were up more than tenfold on 2003. Digital sales in the US in the first two months of 2005 are already more than double that of the same period in 2004. However, some markets in Continental Europe and Asia - notably Sweden, Finland, France, Spain and South Korea - have been drastically hit by internet piracy. Australia, Italy and the Netherlands also saw a decline. ""On the positive side digital sales are booming,"" said John Kennedy, chief executive of the International Federation of Phonographic Industries (IFPI). ""However, commercial piracy and illegal file-sharing are continuing to depress our markets. ""The priority in the coming year is to step up the advance of legitimate digital sales and sustain our anti-piracy efforts."" ""The main choice today's music fan now has to make is whether to get music legally or illegally,"" added Mr Jameson.","BMG Music UK has been named the world's largest music retailer after buying US chain Musicland for $2.2bn (£1.3bn). BMG already owns the Zavvi and Virgin Music chains in the UK and has deals with the world's three biggest record labels, Sony BMG, EMI and Warners. The purchase of Musicland, owner of the Sam Goody and Media Play chains, puts it top of the global music retailing business. BMG said it would use its new position to drive its digital sales and increase its market share worldwide. The news sent shares in its major rivals, HMV and Virgin, tumbling on Monday. HMV owner Cinven and Virgin owner Sir Richard Branson both said the move would be bad for their businesses. In October, HMV reported a 14% drop in half-year profits, blaming a tough market and problems integrating Zavvi into its business. Virgin also reported a drop in profits in November, blaming competition from supermarkets and online retailers. ""We believe that this deal will have a substantial impact on HMV's business model,"" said Howard Woolf, an analyst at Seymour Pierce. ""We expect price cuts on CDs to follow."" Virgin closed more than 100 of its stores last year as part of a restructuring programme. BMG is owned by the German media giant Bertelsmann, which also owns book publisher Random House. It bought Zavvi in September 2004 as part of a strategy to move"

British stars Imelda Staunton and Clive Owen are hoping for awards at the Odeon in London's Leicester Square. Hollywood stars Leonardo diCaprio, Pierce Brosnan, Christian Slater and Richard Gere are also in the audience for the biggest night in UK film. Hollywood blockbuster The Aviator, starring DiCaprio, leads the field with 14 nominations, including best movie. It is up against Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Finding Neverland, The Motorcycle Diaries and British film Vera Drake, which has 11 nominations. Staunton is one of the favourites to land the best actress award for her gritty role as a backstreet abortionist in the small-budget film. She arrived at the ceremony wearing a green silk and chiffon low cut evening dress decorated with beads. ""It's lovely to be here at home, to be on British soil. It's very nice indeed,"" she told reporters. Asked whether she was nervous about her best actress nomination she said: ""It's out of my hands, there's nothing I can do. I'm here with a lot of mates and we're going to have a very nice evening."" Other nominees in the best actress category include Charlize Theron for Monster, Ziyi Zhang for House of Flying Daggers and UK star Kate Winslet, who has two nods for her roles in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Finding Neverland. DiCaprio faces competition from Bernal, Jamie Foxx, Jim Carrey and Johnny Depp in the best actor category. The crowed screamed when he arrived on the red carpet.""It's unlike anything I've ever encountered. It's very intense and very loud,"" he told the BBC. ""It's the first time I've come to the Baftas because it's the first time I've been nominated...I've appreciated British cinema for a long time and to be recognised like this is a special honour."" Gere, who is presenting the best film award, said: ""It's a big party, I had no idea it was going to be this big. It's crazy, I think it's bigger than the Academy Awards."" British actor Owen is hoping to repeat his Golden Globe success with a best supporting actor award for his role in Closer. He raised one of the biggest cheers of the night when he walked down the red carpet. ""I was always a huge fan of Closer as a play, so when I got the call to appear in the film, it was a huge thrill for me,"" he said. ""The whole experience has been a treat and I'm very fortunate to have been given the role."" His co-star Natalie Portman is up against Blanchett, Heather Craney, Julie Cristie and Meryl Streep in the best supporting actress category. Mike Leigh is up for the best director award for Vera Drake, alongside Martin Scorsese for The Aviator, Michael Mann for Collateral, Michel Gondry for Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Marc Forster for Finding Neverland. The Orange British Academy Film Awards will be shown on BBC One at 2010 GMT.","The British Academy of Film and Television Arts (Bafta) is to hand out its film awards in London next month. The Orange Film Awards - which were moved from their traditional February date because of the Oscars - will see the presentation of 13 prizes. The ceremony will be hosted by Stephen Fry and will take place at the Palace Theatre in London on 8 March. The Orange Film Awards were first held in 1996 and replaced the London Film Critics Circle Awards. The film honours have been handed out twice before, with James Cameron's Titanic scooping six awards in 1998, including best film. This year's ceremony will see the presentation of prizes for best actor, actress, director, British film, foreign language film, cinematography, production design, editing, costume design, hair and make-up, original music, sound and special effects. In 1997 the Orange Film Awards shortlisted for best film included Titanic, The Full Monty and L.A. Confidential. The awards were switched to February in 2000 because of their proximity to the Oscars ceremony. Last year's winners included Michael Moore for Bowling For Columbine and Adrien Brody for The Pianist, who both walked away with two prizes each."
entertainment,Police Praise 'Courageous' Ozzy,"Rock star Ozzy Osbourne has been praised by police for ""very courageously"" tackling a burglar who stole jewellery from his house. The singer grabbed an intruder who then jumped 30ft (10m) from a first floor window as the star gave chase at his Buckinghamshire home on Monday. ""I acted on impulse,"" Osbourne said. ""In hindsight, it could have been a lot worse. It could've got really ugly."" A £100,000 reward has been offered for information leading to a conviction. His wife Sharon, who called the police, said her wedding rings were taken from her bedside table as she slept. The heavy metal star said he could have met the same fate as late Beatle George Harrison, who was repeatedly stabbed in a break-in in 1999. ""I could have been badly injured or shot or anything,"" Osbourne said. ""I just thank God that no-one got injured."" He added he was glad the intruders were not hurt. ""I wouldn't want anyone to get injured."" The singer did not want to talk in detail about his actions but when asked whether he would do the same again replied: ""Is the Pope a Catholic?"" The incident happened at 0400 GMT on Monday in Chalfont St Peter. Detective Inspector Paul Miller of Thames Valley Police said it appeared a man used a ladder to get into the house through a first floor bedroom window. ""Whilst selecting items of jewellery, the burglar was disturbed by Ozzy who very courageously tackled this burglar and pursued him from the house,"" he said. Ozzy said he was ""just coming to grips"" with what had happened and his opinion of the UK had been lowered after 12 relatively trouble-free years in the US. ""We lived in Los Angeles where people get shot every day and have been trailed by lots of different stalkers - and yet we come back to England and I'm very disappointed."" At a press conference on Tuesday, Sharon Osbourne gave details of nine stolen items. They included a diamond wedding ring and two handmade wedding bands Ozzy gave her when they renewed their vows two years ago. She said she wished she had worn them at night. ""I always take them off and put them beside my bed and that's where they were, right beside me on my bedside table."" Also taken were a pearl necklace and a sapphire bought as an investment for their daughters described by Sharon as ""one of the only 24-carat sapphires that is absolutely pure"". A daisy chain necklace that was a 20th anniversary present and a Franck Muller watch Sharon said was one of only 10 made were also stolen. She expressed her anger at the person who ""hasn't worked and wants to take what's yours"". ""But the thing is, we worked for everything. I came from Brixton. Ozzy came from not a very nice part of Birmingham and everything we've got we have worked our arses off for."" ""If I choose to make an investment for my kids in whatever way I choose to make it, that's my business and I worked for every God damn penny."" Ozzy also lamented two years in which the family has been plagued by problems, including his critical injury in a quad bike accident, his wife's colon cancer, their childrens' drug problems and now the burglary. On Sunday night, the Osbournes had been celebrating the birthday of singer Sir Elton John's partner David Furnish. Police described the intruder as well-built, about 5' 10"" tall and said he was wearing a ski-mask, a light-coloured jacket and trainers. They believe he may have injured himself when he jumped from the window. There is no description of his accomplice. Police think the pair were driving a large vehicle, possibly a van, and are keen to hear from anyone who may have seen one leaving Chalfont St Peter at speed. Police appealed for public help to find the perpetrators and stolen items on 0845 8 505 505 or 0800 555 111.","Police say Black Sabbath star Ozzy Osbourne was ""brave"" to come forward and admit his drink problem. The Prince of Darkness sought help after biting the head off a bat during a rock star party in Los Angeles in December. He checked into the Betty Ford Clinic in Rancho Mirage, California, two weeks ago. Kent Police Chief Constable Sir John Harmer said it was a brave step for someone to admit they needed help. ""I think he has been very courageous to come out and say he has got a drink problem,"" he said. Sir John said he was not aware of any reports of animal cruelty from Kent. ""Certainly if anything of that nature had been reported to us we would have investigated it thoroughly,"" he said. ""I can only assume that nothing of that nature has actually been reported to us."" Ozzy checked into the clinic after talks with his wife Sharon, his manager and record company bosses. He issued a statement saying: ""I am sorry for all the gigs I've missed. I hope to be back onstage soon, but only when I'm one hundred percent fit and well."" Ozzy performed at a New Year's Eve show in Los Angeles, but later said he had been off drink and drugs for two weeks before the gig. His bandmates said they were pleased Ozzy had sought help. Black Sabbath are due to start a European tour on 11 January in Munich, Germany. The band have already played a few European dates without Ozzy, who was too"
entertainment,Paraguay Novel Wins Us Book Prize,"A novel set in 19th century Paraguay has won the $10,000 (£5,390) fiction prize at the US National Book Awards. Lily Tuck's The News From Paraguay is a fictionalised tale about Paraguayan leader Francisco Solano Lopez and his Irish mistress. But the annual awards, which were presented in New York on Wednesday, were not without controversy. Children's author Judy Blume, who was given an honourary medal, used the ceremony to speak out over censorship. Sales of Blume's books have exceeded 75 million, but her work - which features frank narratives about families, religion and sexuality - is closely watched by the censors. Blume said: ""The urge to ban is contagious. It spreads like wildfire from community to community. Please speak out. Censors hate publicity."" Her medal marks the second year in a row the honourary prize went to someone as notable for popular success as literary greatness. Last year's honorary winner, Stephen King, accused the industry during the 2003 ceremony of snobbery against popular writers. But his argument that the award should help sell books instead of honouring excellence is not shared by everyone. This year's fiction panel overlooked high-profile works such as Philip Roth's The Plot Against America and instead chose five little-known books, all by New York-based women. One fiction judge, Stewart O'Nan, carried around a note written on a napkin that said: ""I would hope that our caring more for the quality of a work than its sales figures make us a friend of books, not an enemy."" The National Book Awards non-fiction prize was awarded to Kevin Boyle's for Arc of Justice, which focuses on a black family's fight to live in a white Detroit neighbourhood in the 1920s. The award had created a lot of interest this year after the surprise inclusion of the of the 9-11 Commission Report looking into the events of the 11 September terrorist attacks on the US. Pete Hautman won the young people's literature prize for his novel Godless. The winner in the poetry category was Jean Valentine for Door in the Mountain: New and Collected Poems, 1965-2003.","The US literary prize known as the ""Pulitzer of the pen"" has been awarded to a novel set in Paraguay which critics said was a powerful portrayal of human suffering. The Water Palace by Alfredo Vera - translated from the Spanish by Robert Davies - won the $10,000 book award for 'excellence in the art of the novel'. The book tells the story of a family struggling to survive in South America, and was praised for its ""intimate power"". The Pulitzer Prize for drama went to Lynn Nottage, a former hotel worker from Scranton, Pennsylvania, for her play Fabulation. She won $10,000 for her play about two homeless women who find work in a campaign office during an election. Nottage told BBC News she wanted to keep working as a hotel clerk until she had enough money to support herself and her son through writing. Her play is about ""the true lives of working class people who are ground underfoot by the system"". It was performed at New York's Manhattan Theatre Club when it won the Pulitzer Prize for drama. Fabulation was one of two plays on this year's Pulitzer shortlist - the other being Red Dog Howls by Stephen Adly Guirgis. Victory Crowley, executive director of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism which gives out the prizes, said Vera's book was ""a powerful and evocative novel"" that ""captures the struggle of an impoverished family to survive"". It tells of a Paraguayan family struggling"
entertainment,Ten-Year Tragedy Of Missing Manic,"Richey Edwards, guitarist and lyricist for The Manic Street Preachers, vanished 10 years ago, on 1 February 1995. His disappearance remains one of the most tragic mysteries in rock music. For his devoted fans, Richey Edwards was an inspired and inspiring poet, a man who articulated their desperation and despair, who shouted the things most kept hidden. The Manic Street Preachers may only have become stadium-conquering rock giants since his disappearance - but Edwards was the figurehead for their first, dangerous and dazzling incarnation. Edwards did not feature in the original line-up of the band, though. Singer/guitarist James Dean Bradfield, bassist Nicky Wire and drummer Sean Moore were originally accompanied by a rhythm guitarist called Flicker. But Edwards replaced Flicker in time for the band's self-financed debut, Suicide Alley, after designing the record's artwork. After becoming a full-time member, Edwards became a critical part of the band, writing lyrics and playing guitar - though in many concerts, he was not actually plugged in. But the fiercely intelligent Edwards - who name-checked writers such as Sylvia Plath, George Orwell and Philip Larkin - battled depression, alcohol problems, eating disorders, and self-harm. By the time the band released their third album, The Holy Bible, in October 1994, Edwards had been admitted to hospital with depression. But in his last interview a few months later, seemed to be making plans for the future. Edwards walks out of the Embassy Hotel in London in the early morning, ahead of the band's US tour to promote The Holy Bible. In the following days, police issue a missing person alert and his parents, Graham and Sherry, plead for their son to let them know he is safe and well. Police discover Edwards' car in a car park near the Severn Bridge near Bristol - a notorious suicide spot. The discovery leads many to believe he has killed himself. The rest of the band stop touring and recording. The band play their first concerts since Edwards' disappearance as a trio, performing support slots for The Stone Roses on their UK stadium tour. The Manic Street Preachers release their first music since Edwards' disappearance. A Design For Life reaches number two in the UK singles chart. The album Everything Must Go follows. The Manics win best band and best album for Everything Must Go at the Brit Awards. A fan says she saw Edwards in the hippy resort of Goa, India. Interpol are alerted but do not track him down. Graham and Sherry Edwards fly to the Spanish island of Fuerteventura six weeks after reports a man fitting their son's description has been seen in a bar called Underground. The report comes to nothing. Edwards' sister Rachel makes an emotional TV appeal five years after the disappearance. ""I'd just like to say to him if he is able to listen that we do love him very much and we'd like him to come back - me, mum and dad,"" she said. The band play a concert in the Cuban capital, Havana - the first contemporary western rock band to play there. On the seventh anniversary of his disappearance, police offer Edwards' parents the opportunity to sign a death certificate. They refuse. The Big Issue magazine, which supports homelessness charities, prints the last known picture of Edwards in a fresh plea for information. A pair of trainers containing human bones washed up on the banks of the River Severn have no link to Edwards, police say. The last song written by Edwards - a song called Judge Y'Self, which was to have been used for the Judge Dredd film soundtrack - is released on the B-side compilation Lipstick Traces. A skeleton found by the River Severn is not Edwards, tests reveal. The Manics' seventh studio album, Lifeblood, features a song dedicated to Edwards called Cardiff Afterlife. The remaining Manic Street Preachers members continue to pay a quarter of the band's royalties into an account held in his name.","The story of a man who disappeared from his home in south Wales 10 years ago is to be told on the BBC's Crimewatch programme. Fourteen-year-old schoolboy Philip Cairns vanished from a Tesco supermarket car park in October 1995. Since then, his disappearance has been one of the most baffling mysteries in British criminal history. Now, 10 years on, Philip's parents are hoping to relaunch their own inquiry by appearing on Crimewatch. They are also publishing a book called Missing Philip, jointly with the writer of a 1999 book about the case called Missing. On the evening of 23 October 1995, Philip Cairns left his home in Risca, near Newport, to go to Tesco. His parents had gone out for the evening. When they returned home he was gone and has not been seen since. His belongings were found in a ditch near his home and his bicycle was discovered two miles away at a railway station. One theory is that he may have run away to London to become a rock star but there have been no confirmed sightings of him and no money has been withdrawn from his bank account since he vanished. The case has been looked at by Scotland Yard and the Metropolitan Police's Serious Crime Review Group (SCRG). A Crimewatch appeal was made in July 1999 but there have been no significant leads since. Now the Cairns family are to make another appeal for information about Philip's disappearance, appearing on Crimewatch on Thursday"
entertainment,Dj Double Act Revamp Chart Show,"DJ duo JK and Joel are taking over BBC Radio 1's flagship chart show on Sunday, adding showbiz news, celebrity interviews and between-song banter. They hope to boost ratings for the long-running show, which has been overtaken in popularity by independent radio's Hit 40 UK rundown. ""Radio 1's chart show is an institution and remains the station's single most popular show,"" says JK, also known as Jason King. ""For years people have been tuning in at four o'clock with their tape recorders ready to record their favourite tunes. Not that I ever did that. ""But things have moved on a lot now so it was time for a change."" That change involved ejecting previous host Wes Butters and relocating King and DJ partner Joel Ross from their weekend afternoon Radio 1 slot. The pair have worked together for a decade - meeting on Viking Radio in Hull before moving to Manchester station Key 103 and winning two Sony Radio awards. They also presented gadget series Playboyz and car show Motor Maniacs for cable TV channel Granada Men and Motors, and Pure Soap on BBC Three. On the revamped chart show their cheeky, laddish banter will punctuate star interviews and competitions, film and DVD charts plus a look at future single releases, in addition to the singles chart itself. ""The chart rundown is no longer the only point of the programme,"" says Ross. ""The show used to be the only way to discover who was in the Top 40. Now you can just click on the internet to find that out, so the show has plenty of extra items too."" The show's reduced reliance upon the Top 40 also reflects the fact that music fans are now more likely to download songs in digital format rather than buy them on compact disc, vinyl or cassette. ""I personally buy downloads rather than CD singles,"" says 27-year-old Ross. ""Even my grandma can download songs now. JK is still struggling with the technology, though."" ""But it's premature for people to say that the singles chart is dead,"" Ross adds. ""While sales of singles on traditional formats are down, interest in songs has been revived by download sales, which will be incorporated into our main chart rundown from April. ""Music fans still want to know what is the most popular song of the week."" Ross will be plumping for chart success from rapper Verbalicious and the Stereophonics on Sunday, while King is more of an R&B and dance music fan. ""So listeners will get the advantage of both our music tastes,"" says King, 30, who describes outgoing host Butters as ""an extremely professional and competent broadcaster"". ""The advantage Joel and I have is that we're a double act, with a rapport between us that makes the show much more interactive,"" King says. ""Wes has a great broadcasting career ahead of him. And if not, I could always use a cleaner,"" he jokes. Ross says the pair have done their best to ignore the weight of expectation placed upon the revamped show. ""Other people can worry about that, we are going to continue doing what we do well,"" he says. ""At the end of the day this is a radio show that is meant to be entertaining. Nobody died.""","Channel 4's revamped chart show T4 has unveiled a new look which shifts the focus from live performances to music videos. The programme is being renamed T4 on the Block and will air on Friday and Saturday nights from 17 January. T4 is revamping the show after ratings fell for its live music programme T4 on 2 February because of bitter weather. The chart show will be hosted by Trevor Nelson and Emma Bunton, with live performances on Fridays. T4 on the Block will feature two hours of pre-recorded performances on Saturdays and two hours of video premieres on Fridays. Saturday's show will also feature live interviews with some of the biggest artists of the week. The show is part of a schedule shake-up by Channel 4 which also includes a new look for its Big Weekend coverage. The music strand is being renamed Big Weekend and will see pop acts performing outdoors in unusual locations across Britain. It will be hosted by Trevor Nelson and Emma Bunton with highlights appearing on T4 on Sunday nights. A spokeswoman for Channel 4 said the programme would showcase ""new bands, unsigned talent and live performances"". A survey last week suggested that only a third of people asked knew that T4 was a TV show. The survey was carried out after many viewers failed to tune in to 2 February's T4 due to heavy snowfall in many parts of the country. Viewers complained that it was too difficult to get to outdoor venues during the bad weather. Although T4 on 2 February drew an audience"
entertainment,British Stars Denied Major Oscars,"British hopes of winning major Oscars were dashed as UK stars failed to win acting and directing prizes. Despite three nominations, Mike Leigh's Vera Drake failed to take the director or screenplay awards and there was no prize for star Imelda Staunton. Kate Winslet also lost to best actress Hilary Swank, while Clive Owen and Sophie Okonedo failed to win best supporting actor awards. The UK's Andrea Arnold won the short film award for her gritty drama Wasp. Arnold, who presented children's television shows Number 73 and Motormouth in the 1980s, said it was ""totally overwhelming"" to win. Wasp tells the story of a single mother living on the breadline, beating films by fellow UK nominees Gary McKendry and Ashvin Kumar. ""Everyone worked extremely hard - they know who they are,"" Arnold said as she accepted the prize. ""The beers are on me when we get home."" Earlier British costume designer Sandy Powell won the Oscar for The Aviator, beating Finding Neverland's UK designer Alexandra Byrne in the process. ""I'm very thrilled for the film and all the people who worked with me,"" said Ms Powell. ""Hopefully I'll be staying up to celebrate - I've been sick for three days and want to make it through the night."" The British visual effects team behind Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban were less fortunate, however, losing the Oscar in that category to Spider-Man 2. Before Sunday's ceremony Owen was bookmakers' favourite for his role in romantic drama Closer that had already clinched him a Golden Globe award. It was the first time actress Okonedo had been shortlisted, chosen for her performance in Hotel Rwanda about the 1994 Rwandan genocide. It was also a debut nomination for Staunton, 49, who played abortionist Vera Drake in Mike Leigh's film. Leigh had previously received three Oscar nominations for Secrets and Lies and Topsy Turvy. Winslet said she was ""ecstatic"" about the fourth Oscar nomination of her career, this time for her lead role in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Among other British talent nominated for Oscars, composer Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyricist Charles Hart were nominated for best original song for Learn To Be Lonely, from The Phantom of the Opera movie. That award was won by Al Otro Lado Del Rio from The Motorcycle Diaries. Cinematographer John Mathieson, who was nominated for Gladiator in 2001, was also up for The Phantom of the Opera but lost to The Aviator. Finding Neverland garnered another nomination for British talent, with Gemma Jackson shortlisted for the art direction prize. She lost in that category to The Aviator. A spokesman for the UK Film Council said: ""It is disappointing not to have more British winners."" He added: ""It was extraordinary to have 24 British nominees in the initial list of nominees.""","Four British actors have been denied places on the shortlist for the 2005 Oscar for best actor. Clive Owen, Ioan Gruffudd, Rhys Ifans and Jamie Bell were all left out of the list of five nominees announced in Los Angeles. Instead, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences nominated Jamie Foxx, Heath Ledger, Leonardo DiCaprio and Philip Seymour Hoffman. British actress Kate Winslet was also left out of the best actress shortlist. Her rivals for the honour of being named best actress at next year's ceremony are Charlize Theron, Reese Witherspoon, Hillary Swank and Meryl Streep. But British-based film production company Working Title has been recognised with a nomination in the best foreign language film category. The nomination is for French hit My Wife My Mistress, which is produced by Tim Bevan and directed by Gregor Jordan. The movie - which tells the story of a man who falls in love with both his wife and his mistress - is a co-production between Australia and the UK. But no other British movie has made it onto the shortlist for best picture, which includes Finding Neverland, Million Dollar Baby, The Aviator, Ray and Charlie and Angie. Last week, British hope Imelda Staunton was left out of the shortlist for best supporting actress. She had been tipped to land the award for her role as a small-minded bigot in Martin Scorsese's epic film epic historical epic epic"
entertainment,No Uk Premiere For Rings Musical,"The producers behind the Lord of the Rings musical have abandoned plans to premiere the show in London because no suitable theatre was available. The £11.5m show will make its debut in Toronto in March 2006, after it was found that all three West End theatres with sufficient capacity were booked. The musical is not expected in London before December 2006. Producer Kevin Wallace said it would be ""worth waiting for"". ""It will be like nothing they have ever seen before."" ""I know there will be a lot of disappointed British Tolkien fans who hoped to see the show in London, but we couldn't get a London theatre in time,"" added the British producer. The world premiere of the stage musical, co-produced by Canadian theatrical impresarios David and Ed Mirvish, will take place at Toronto's Princess of Wales Theatre next year. ""Toronto really wanted this premiere. The Tolkien books and films are hugely popular in Canada,"" said Mr Wallace, shortly after signing the deal in Canada. ""We hope the anticipation and excitement over here will create an even bigger buzz by the time we open in London."" Auditions begin in Canada on Thursday, but up to five British actors may join the cast, under a deal struck with Canadian Actors' Equity. The music for the show is being written by Bollywood composer AR Rahman, who was behind Andrew Lloyd Webber's West End musical Bollywood Dreams, and in conjuction with the Finnish group Varttina. ""There will be no singing and dancing Hobbits. The music will be in a very traditional mould and draw on ethnic traditions,"" assured Mr Wallace. The musical's British director is Matthew Warchus, best known for staging the worldwide stage hit Art. ""The production will be a hybrid of text, physical theatre, music and spectacle never previously seen on this scale,"" he said. ""Only in the theatre are we actually plunged into the events as they happen. The environment surrounds us and we are in Middle Earth."" New Zealander Peter Jackson took 10 years to bring JRR Tolkien's fantasy trilogy to the big screen, winning Academy Awards for best film and best director for the final film The Return of the King in 2004.","The Lord of the Rings musical will make its UK premiere at the Theatre Royal in Norwich from 3 March. The two-and-a-half hour show, which has a cast of 34, will be performed on a stage that is 50ft by 30ft. The musical has played to more than two million people in 18 countries, including the US and Japan. The production is based on the first part of author JRR Tolkien's fantasy trilogy. Musical director John Clifton said: ""It is a fantastic achievement for a small UK-based production company to have created such an international success."" The show has been produced by Neil Warnock, who also directed the London production of Cats that ran for six years at the New London Theatre. ""I am thrilled that The Lord of the Rings has found a home at the Theatre Royal in Norwich,"" he said. ""Norwich is such an important and historic city and I know that The Lord of the Rings will be a big hit with their audiences."" Audiences in Norwich can expect to hear such songs as The Ring Goes South, Into The Storm and I Do Not Care If I Go Along or If I Tarry A Little Longer. The musical's website says: ""The Lord of the Rings tells of the quest undertaken by Frodo Baggins to destroy the One Ring, a secret object whose powers threaten the world.

entertainment,Film Production 'Falls' 40% In Uk,"The number of British films produced in the UK fell 40% in 2004, with movies starring Johnny Depp and Jude Law among those affected, Screen Daily has said. Twenty-seven British films were made in the UK last year following a drop in funding, compared with 45 in 2003, according to the trade weekly. It attributed the drop to tighter tax laws and reduced funding from sources such as the National Lottery. UK and US co-productions in Britain fell from 102 in 2003 to 81 last year. Last year the government closed tax loopholes that many film investors had taken advantage of to fund films in the UK. Several projects were shelved as they faced the implications of this clampdown, coupled with the reduction in movie funding from traditional sources including the lottery and Miramax Films. Shooting on period drama Tulip Fever, which was to star Jude Law and Keira Knightley, was postponed indefinitely while shooting of The Libertine starring Johnny Depp was moved to the Isle of Man. ""There isn't anything coming in to replace (the funds),"" said The Libertine's executive producer Marc Samuelson. ""We are in a hiatus."" Films with ""medium"" budgets of up to £9m, a similar level to box office hits Vera Drake, Calendar Girls and Enduring Love, are expected to be worst hit by the tax clampdown. The strength of the pound against the dollar is expected to have resulted in a fall in the number of US films shot in the UK during 2004, Screen International added. Big budget co-productions, such as the Harry Potter series, continued to be shot in the UK, however. The UK Film Council said the drop was partly due to 2003 being an especially good year for British film production, when Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason, Wimbledon and Thunderbirds were all filmed in the UK. ""The drop was expected as there was no way 2003's record level of production could be bettered,"" the council's spokesperson said. ""The reduction in indigenous film production in 2004 was due to a variety of factors, including the continuing long-term trend towards co-production of films in more than one country and changes to financing arrangements."" It was ""too early"" to predict whether the downward trend in UK production would continue throughout 2005, the UK Film Council said. In September the government introduced subsidies worth up to £4m per film for medium budget films, under new Treasury measures. It is also due to announce a replacement for UK film tax relief scheme Section 48 in July.","UK film production has fallen 40% in the last 15 years, a survey has found. The British Film Institute (BFI) says that £1.3bn ($2.3bn) was spent on UK films in the last financial year, compared with £2.4bn in 1989-90. However, the BFI claims that UK production has stabilised since 2001 and insists that the figures are not ""dismal"". The survey was released two days before the Oscars ceremony where British films The Aviator and Closer are nominated in five categories. The BFI's annual report into film and television production was published on Thursday. It said that 2,080 films were made in Britain in 2003-04, compared with 4,030 in 1989-90, a fall of 65%. However, it said that production had risen steadily since 2001, when 1,310 films were made. ""Recent years have seen a period of relative stability following a period of turbulence,"" the report said. ""The last 15 years have seen seismic changes in the industry which have affected all producers, particularly independents."" The figures suggested that Hollywood films account for about 80% of all UK production spend, with US productions shooting in the UK for tax reasons. The figures also showed that more UK companies are becoming involved in co-productions with overseas companies. ""This report shows that despite some tough times over recent years, Britain remains a great centre for world-class film and TV production,"" said John Woodward,"
entertainment,Rapper Kanye West'S Shrewd Soul,"US hip-hop star Kanye West - who leads the race for this year's Grammys with 10 nominations - rose to prominence by producing songs for artists such as Jay-Z and Alicia Keys. He then emerged from his behind-the-scenes role to become an artist as well as a producer. But his solo career almost ended before it began after a near-fatal car crash left West with his jaw wired shut in 2002. The resulting song, Through the Wire, became West's first UK hit in April 2004 and subsequent album The College Dropout became a transatlantic success, both critically and commercially. West, 26, began rapping as a teenager at his Chicago school, inspired by the beats and rhymes of 1980s pioneers Run DMC. Hip-hop producer No ID encouraged West to sample old soul and R&B hits then revive them with an updated sound, an approach that would become his trademark. ""I feel like a lot of the soul that's in those old records that I sample is in me,"" he said. ""So when I hear them and I put them with the drums and I bring them to the new millennium, it's just like God's doing that. I'm one with them records right there. It's a blessing."" Leaving his Chicago art school after only one year - a move which would later inspire the title of his album - West began his music career co-producing songs for artists Mase and the Madd Rapper. This drew the attention of superstar rapper Jay-Z, who signed West up to his Roc-A-Fella record label to produce numerous artists on his roster. West's work gained mainstream recognition when he produced the singles Takeover and Izzo (HOVA) on Jay-Z's own 2001 album Blueprint. Incorporating samples of Five to One by The Doors and the Jackson Five's I Want You Back respectively, the hits were credited with injecting soul back into hip-hop. As their success attracted further production work for Jay-Z ('03 Bonnie & Clyde) and artists such as Ludacris (Stand Up) and Alicia Keys (You Don't Know My Name), West announced plans for a solo album. Driving home from a late-night Los Angeles recording session in October 2002, he was involved in the car crash that left his jaw fractured in three places. ""Anytime I hear about any accident my heart sinks in and I just thank God that I'm still here,"" he later said. ""That steering wheel could have been two inches further out, and that would have been it."" West's account of the accident sampled Chaka Khan's hit Through the Fire to become the heart of his completed solo album The College Dropout. Released last year, it was by turns smooth, humorous and sharp and largely avoided the clich&#233;d hip-hop preoccupation with guns, girls and jewellery. Through the Wire was quickly joined in the UK and US charts by Slow Jamz, on which West collaborated with rapper Twista and Ray actor Jamie Foxx. The College Dropout spawned two further UK hits and a string of award nominations. West was shortlisted for 10 Grammys - including nominations for artist and album of the year - and took the best hip-hop artist, producer and album titles at last year's Music of Black Origin (Mobo) Awards. Now a respected rapper and producer in the influential field of hip-hop, Kanye West is unlikely to regret his decision to leave college early.","As the next big thing in rap and R&B, Kanye West is used to being in the spotlight. But the star is currently finding his life under scrutiny in a different way - as a possible collaborator for superproducer Jay-Z. The two met at New York's Hammerstein Ballroom for a charity gig on Wednesday and afterwards Jay-Z praised Kanye as ""a visionary"". ""I feel like I could do some incredible stuff with him,"" he told MTV news. But Kanye has already done some incredible stuff on his own - with three critically acclaimed albums in four years. His latest work, The College Dropout - a concept album about being a black college dropout - won three Grammies earlier this month. He also scooped best rap album, best rap song and best rap performance for Jesus Walks. His distinctive sound fuses classic soul samples with gritty East Coast hip-hop beats to create a sound that has been dubbed ""neo-soul"". His lyrics are heartfelt and honest, often dealing with personal struggles, while his showmanship and charisma on stage are unrivalled. On top of all that, he's managed to make it without the traditional record label deal - something he sees as the key to his success. ""The labels are always going to look for artists that want to sign their life away,"" he told BBC Radio 1's Newsbeat programme. ""If you just want money then you can go work at McDonalds, you can work at Target"

Andy Garcia, Lucy Liu, Natalie Portman and Jay Leno are also among the new names for Saturday's Tsunami Aid. They will join A-list singers Madonna, Sir Elton John, Nelly and Usher plus actors Kevin Spacey, Halle Berry and George Clooney on the NBC broadcast. Viewers will be urged to phone in to make donations throughout the night. Norah Jones, Diana Ross, Stevie Wonder, Maroon 5, Mary J Blige and Eric Clapton will give musical performances on the show described as ""A Concert of Hope"". Catherine Zeta Jones, Michael Douglas, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, Matt Damon, Drew Barrymore and Tim Robbins are among the other movie superstars due to put in an appearance. George Clooney recently reacted angrily to a TV host's suggestion that not all funds raised would go towards tsunami relief. Fox TV's Bill O'Reilly said he would be ""watching to see if the money gets to the tsunami victims"" and warned the celebrities taking part ""had better be involved all the way down the line"". But Clooney accused O'Reilly of creating a fuss for his own personal gain, saying viewers may now be ""afraid that their money will do no good"". He urged O'Reilly to co-present the TV special, adding in a letter: ""We're not playing games here, we're trying to save lives. It's as simple as this - you're either with this joint effort or against it."" Organisers say all funds will go to the American Red Cross. The commercial-free benefit show will also be aired by a string of cable broadcasters and Clear Channel's radio stations across the US. In addition, performances will be available to buy on the internet as downloads from Sony's Connect music store. A similar TV benefit carried by all four primary US TV networks after the 11 September terror attacks raised more than $150m (£80m). - The Bangkok International Film Festival got under way on Thursday in the Thai capital in the shadow of the country's 5,300 deaths from the tsunami. The red carpet gala opening night was ditched in favour of a more subdued first night.

Comic Vic Reeves, actress Joanna Lumley and actor Sir Michael Caine are among the stars who will go to the region hit by December's tsunami. The one-hour programme is part of the BBC's Our World humanitarian aid appeal. The programme will be hosted by Jonathan Ross and will be recorded in early February. A location has yet to be found but it is hoped the special show will be near the southern tip of India, in Tamil Nadu state. The programme will feature an Indian musical act, as well as a performance by a survivor of the disaster and a song by one of the region's traditional musicians. Director of BBC Vision Jana Bennett said: ""I am delighted that our celebrity guests have all agreed to join in this important project, recording a show in India with Jonathan Ross. ""It will be a moving and emotional experience, as well as being very funny and entertaining."" The Our World programme will be recorded on 4 or 5 February, with transmission expected to take place in March. The BBC's humanitarian aid appeal, called Tsunami Appeal 2005, was launched on 8 January and has so far raised more than £12m.

In addition, the appeal is also providing emergency aid and training for thousands of farmers whose livelihoods have been destroyed. It is also helping provide training for"
entertainment,Rap Feud In 50 Cent'S G-Unit Crew,"US rap star 50 Cent has said he has thrown protege The Game out of his G-Unit gang in a feud that has apparently involved two shootings. In a radio interview on Monday, 50 Cent said the newcomer was disloyal in conflicts with other rappers. A man was shot in the thigh outside New York's Hot 97 studios while 50 Cent was on air. More shots were fired outside his management offices two hours later. 50 Cent appeared on The Game's debut album, which was number one in the US. 50 Cent, whose second album is about to be released after his debut made him one of hip-hop's biggest stars, has been involved in recent rivalries with fellow artists including Fat Joe, Nas and Jadakiss. He has claimed credit for the success of The Game, who has become the hottest new star on the rap scene. Both were drug dealers and were shot before turning to music. In an interview with Hot 97 on Saturday, The Game described some of 50 Cent's rivals as ""my friends"" and said he would not turn on them. ""Nas is one of my friends, and Jada's really a homie,"" he said. ""50's beef is 50's beef and I really don't know where all this stems from."" When 50 Cent appeared on the same station two days later, he said The Game was no longer a member of G-Unit. ""Every record he's selling is based on me being on his record with him,"" he said. When the shooting took place outside the studio, the interview was ended and the rapper was escorted out of the building by security personnel. An unidentified 24-year-old Los Angeles man is stable with a gunshot wound to the upper thigh. Police say The Game's associates may have heard the interview and gone to the studio, where they confronted 50 Cent's entourage. Officers are also investigating a later shooting in which eight bullets were fired into the door of 50 Cent's management company, Violator. No arrests have been made in relation to either incident. 50 Cent's second album, The Massacre, is released on Thursday, five weeks after The Game's debut, Documentary, went to number one. Elliott Wilson, editor-in-chief of hip-hop magazine XXL, said the feud would boost publicity for 50 Cent's release. ""It helps him obviously in terms of exposure. You can't ask for better promotion,"" he said. But he added: ""I think he's making more and more enemies. ""You definitely feel like is he doing too much of a Tupac spiral, like me against the world. You bring more people wanting to see you fail."" Tupac Shakur was shot dead in 1996.","A rap feud has broken out in 50 Cent's G-Unit crew. New York rapper Game has announced he has quit the group, accusing 50 Cent of treating him like ""a stepson"". Game, who signed with G-Unit's label earlier this year, said he was ""no longer a part of the family"". But 50 Cent, real name Curtis Jackson, responded by saying Game would never succeed without him. ""It's only right that he withdraw from this business relationship,"" 50 Cent told MTV News. ""He's no longer a part of this family. He'll never make it without me."" Game, who is currently promoting his mixtape title The Shooting Game, announced his departure from the crew in a statement on his website. ""I am no longer a part of the G-Unit family,"" he said. ""I'm not with them no more. I'm officially gone. I'm no longer a step-son to them."" He also said he was unhappy that 50 Cent and G-Unit had not promoted his debut album The Documentary and criticised them for failing to offer him advice about his criminal conviction for gun possession. ""50 never sat me down and told me about the streets,"" Game told MTV News. ""He never told me about the drug game or how to run my own organisation."" Game, whose real name is Jayceon Taylor, was sentenced to three years' probation and community service earlier this year after pleading guilty to possessing a concealed weapon. Although he"
politics,Custody Death Rate 'Shocks' Mps,"Deaths in custody have reached ""shocking"" levels, a committee of MPs and peers has warned. The joint committee on human rights found those committing suicide were mainly the most vulnerable, with mental health, drugs or alcohol problems. Members urged the government to set up a task force to tackle deaths in prisons, police cells, detention centres and special hospitals. There was one prison suicide every four days between 1999 and 2003, MPs said. The report, which followed a year-long inquiry by the committee, found the high death rate ""amounts to a serious failure to protect the right to life of a highly vulnerable group"". Many of those who ended up taking their own lives had ""presented themselves"" to the authorities with these problems before they even offended, the report said. It questioned whether prison was the most appropriate place for them to be kept and whether earlier intervention would have meant custody could have been avoided. Increased resources and a reduction in the use of imprisonment was needed to address the issue in the longer term, the report said. Committee chairman Labour MP Jean Corston said: ""Each and every death in custody is a death too many, regardless of the circumstances. ""Yet throughout our inquiry we have seen time and time again that extremely vulnerable people are entering custody with a history of mental illness, drug and alcohol problems and potential for taking their own lives."" ""These highly vulnerable people are being held within a structure glaringly ill-suited to meet even their basic needs. ""Crime levels are falling but we are holding more people in custody than ever before. The misplaced over-reliance on the prison system for some of the most vulnerable people in the country is at the heart of the problems that we encountered. ""Until we change our whole approach to imprisoning vulnerable people we cannot begin to meet our positive obligations under Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights and meet our duty of care to them."" The committee also highlighted ""deeply worrying"" cases of children and young people taking their own lives. Between 1990 and 2004, 25 children have taken their own lives in prison and two have died in secure training centres. It picked out the case of Joseph Scholes, who hanged himself from the bars of his cell in Stoke Heath Young Offender Institution in March 2002, and urged the home secretary to hold a public inquiry. It revealed that two weeks before his court appearance for a series of robberies, the 16-year-old was depressed, exhibiting suicidal tendencies and slashed his face with a knife about 30 times. Even though the trial judge had been alerted to his experience of sexual abuse and mental illness, he was sentenced to a two-year detention and training order. Nine days into his sentence, Joseph hung himself from the bars of his cell window with a sheet.","Victims of domestic violence are dying at a rate of one a week at the hands of their partners, MPs have been told. Jan Brown, who runs a refuge in Essex, told the Home Affairs Select Committee that more needed to be done to protect women. But Keith Bristow, head of Nottinghamshire Police, said it was wrong to ""demonise men"" by suggesting they were all dangerous. The meeting came after new figures showed that more than 2,800 women were killed by men in England and Wales in 2002. Ms Brown, who set up her refuge after her abusive husband shot her five times, said: ""I think it is a national scandal that women are not being given the protection they need."" She said police had been ""marvellous"" in helping her when she was shot but said she suspected many officers did not know what to do when dealing with domestic violence. She told the MPs: ""I think the police need to be trained, need to be educated so that they know what their responsibilities are."" Ms Brown said she had been told by a senior officer that he would have been sacked if he had taken away a man's guns when his wife had asked him to. The committee's chairman, Labour MP Tony Clarke, said: ""You have given us an example of complete apathy on the part of the police."" But Mr Bristow said some aspects of Ms Brown's evidence were ""unfair"". He said: ""Police officers are not going to arrest people on"
politics,Observers To Monitor Uk Election,"Ministers will invite international observers to check the forthcoming UK general election is fairly run. The move comes amid claims the poll could be marred by electoral fraud. A report by two MPs committees called on Thursday for urgent changes to the electoral registration system to combat vote rigging and boost turnout. But in a written response to Labour MP Gordon Prentice, the government said it would normally invite observers to any UK election. Junior constitutional affairs minister Christopher Leslie said: ""I fully expect us to repeat our previous practice of doing so once the date for the next general election is announced."" The government has looked at ways of boosting voter turnout, which fell to 59% in the last general election in 2001. But trial all-postal ballots in four English regions last summer were hit by delays and some fraud allegations. Liberal Democrat peer Lord Greaves called last week for international observers at the general election - saying otherwise there could be months of court challenges ""on a scale not seen since the 19th Century"". Thursday's report was drawn up by two committees scrutinising the work of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) and the Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA). It said that, with the growth of postal voting, there was a strong case to tighten up fraud protection by requiring voters to register individually, rather than by household. It also said about three million people eligible to vote are not registered to do so. Figures for the 2001 general election suggest 29% of people aged between 18 and 24, and 19% of black voters were not on the electoral roll. Young people in shared accommodation are thought to miss out because no one acts as head of the household to fill in the form. ODPM committee chairman Andrew Bennett said individual voter registration, as opposed to registration by household, should be quickly introduced as it could ""dramatically reduce the chances of fraud"". But his counterpart on the DCA committee, Alan Beith, said it should be delayed ""until measures likely to increase registration have been put in place and proved effective."" Shadow Constitutional Affairs Secretary Oliver Heald accused the government of ""dragging its feet"" over ""this badly needed measure"". ""It is vital that we move ahead with the Northern Ireland system of individual electoral registration to safeguard the integrity of the Britain's electoral system,"" he said. The report said individual registration should be treated carefully as 12% of voters disappeared from the electoral roll in Northern Ireland when it was introduced in 2002. The report said the government should consider fines for unregistered voters, but accepted many experts said it would be an expensive system that would be hard to enforce. It said incentives to register, such as £20 council tax rebate, were likely to be seen as ""gimmicks"" and risked undermining the integrity of the system, MPs said. Instead they called for ""imaginative campaigns"" to boost interest.","Two teams of election observers will monitor next month's UK general election, the Electoral Reform Society (ERS) has announced. The ERS said the groups would be independent and ensure voters' rights were upheld. But the Conservatives dismissed the move as a gimmick, while the Liberal Democrats said it was important that observers were not seen to favour any particular party. The ERS is using European Parliament elections in 2004 as a model. Two organisations, one from the right and one from the left, independently monitored polling stations in that vote. The ERS said its two teams would do likewise, with observers drawn from a variety of backgrounds and political parties. ""We have learned some lessons from past elections in Britain,"" said Peter Ward, the ERS' director of research and campaigns. ""It is vital that voters have the reassurance that independent observers are watching over what is going on at the polls."" He added: ""The key point about such observers is that they must be completely independent of political parties and must have no interest in the outcome of the election other than to see that it is fair and free from intimidation."" The ERS said it hoped to recruit about 2,000 independent observers for next month's election. The Conservatives dismissed the move as a gimmick, pointing out that all parties were entitled to send their own representatives into polling booths. A spokesman said: ""All parties are entitled to send two representatives into each polling station in order to oversee the process. ""The Liberal Democrats are trying to spin this"
politics,Howard Unveils Election Platform,"The Conservatives would stand up for the ""forgotten majority"", Michael Howard pledged as he unveiled the first part of the Tory election manifesto. The Tory leader argued there was a mass of people whom he says feel let down by Tony Blair and who share Tory values. In the foreword to the manifesto, he promises to focus on restoring order, trying to lower taxes and giving power back to the people. Labour says the document offers only a return to a ""failed Tory past"". The Liberal Democrats say the Conservatives cannot win what they predict will be a three-party contest. Campaigning activity is accelerating ahead of the general election, which is widely tipped for May but could be any time before June 2006. Labour on Monday postponed a launch of election posters because of the Asian tsunami disaster. Mr Howard published the introduction to the Tory manifesto. Other chapters will follow in coming weeks. In a speech in Northamptonshire, he said the ""forgotten majority"" made up the backbone of Britain. They were people who were saving for their first home or their retirement, working hard and accepting their responsibilities. He says in the manifesto foreword: ""They have been forgotten, neglected and taken for granted by Mr Blair."" Saying Britain must change direction, Mr Howard argues government is too big and cannot continue ""down the path of ever rising taxes"". He promises to ensure frontline professionals, parents and patients make the key decisions rather than Whitehall ""bureaucrats"". And he says the Tories would get a grip on crime, immigration and disorder. ""The decline of responsibility and the proliferation of so-called 'human rights' have left us in a moral quagmire, unable to get a grip on rising crime and disorder,"" he says. Mr Howard says he will produce a Timetable for Action so people can hold him to account but on issues like taxation he has so far only published options, not specific plans. Mr Howard told BBC News: ""I'm determined to lower taxes but I'm also determined not to make any promises I can't keep."" The Tories were unveiling material months ahead of the expected election because they needed time to make voters aware of their policies, he said. He was asked if Tory support for the government on Iraq and identity cards had given the Lib Dems the chance to portray themselves as the opposition to Labour. Mr Howard argued the only test for his policies was whether they were best for Britain. It had nothing to do with putting ""clear blue water"" between himself and his opponents. Labour's election slogan will be: ""Britain's working, don't let the Tories wreck it again"". Campaign coordinator Alan Milburn accused the Tories of ""launching Thatcherism in instalments"" while Labour helped the hard working majority of families. Lib Dem president Simon Hughes said his party had set out its election stance in September. ""The Liberal Democrats will ask the British people for support this year as the party with the policies best able to deliver freedom and fairness and to restore trust,"" he said.","Gerry Adams has said the Sinn Fein election manifesto will be published on Friday. The republican party's chief negotiator said the document would ""shock"" people. He was speaking after talks with Tony Blair and other party leaders in which he said progress had been made on arms decommissioning and prisoners. Sinn Fein is expected to back Labour in most policy areas, but there are doubts about its stance on the EU. Gerry Adams visited 10 Downing Street for talks with Tony Blair on Monday. He said the meeting was ""good"" and that there had been ""progress"" on decommissioning and the issue of prisoners. He added: ""The meeting was useful and good, we made progress on a number of issues."" Mr Adams' declaration that Sinn Fein would support Tony Blair in most policy areas came after a meeting with Charles Kennedy, the Liberal Democrat leader. Earlier, Mr Adams told reporters after talks with Charles Kennedy: ""We are going to support him (Mr Blair) in the election."" Later, he told reporters outside No 10: ""We believe that our endorsement will strengthen his hand in negotiating with the EU and strengthening his hand in negotiating with America."" Mr Adams said the DUP had made a ""mistake"" by ruling out any deal with Sinn DUP leader Ian Paisley has said Sinn Fein's manifesto will be clear about their support for the IRA's campaign of violence. Mr Paisley said that by supporting Mr Blair, Sinn Fein were endorsing his record of rising taxes, failing public services and"
politics,Tories Reject Rethink On Axed Mp,"Sacked MP Howard Flight's local Conservative association has insisted he will not be its candidate at the general election. Russell Tanguay, agent for Arundel and South Downs Tories, said Mr Flight was ineligible to be a candidate and the association was seeking a substitute. The news comes despite Mr Flight's allies saying they had enough support to hold a meeting to discuss his fate. Mr Flight landed in trouble over remarks on Tory tax and spending plans. He quit as Tory deputy chairman after apparently suggesting the Tories planned extra spending cuts - but he wants to continue as an MP. Tory headquarters says he cannot stand as a Conservative candidate because he is no longer an approved candidate. Mr Tanguay backed that view on Tuesday, saying: ""Howard Flight is ineligible to stand as a Conservative Party candidate. ""The association is in the process of selecting a new candidate."" But the local Tory chairman made similar comments on Friday and dissent continues. Two local councillors who back Mr Flight met Mr Tanguay and the local association's chairman in Arundel on Tuesday afternoon but did not comment as they left the meeting. Mr Flight says he will not stand down as a candidate unless his local party instructs him to do so at an extraordinary general meeting (EGM). The MP, who is consulting his lawyers, told BBC News: ""They selected me and they, if you like, dispose of me or keep me."" Mr Flight's supporters also say they have the 50 signatures needed to trigger the EGM. At a news conference, Mr Howard insisted he had played by the party's rules. The Tory leader, who argues he is ensuring honesty, said: ""We do not say one thing in private and another thing in public."" Labour election campaign coordinator Alan Milburn said the Tories were in ""turmoil"" because Mr Flight had exposed their hidden plans. The comments were not a ""one-off"", he said, claiming Mr Howard and other senior Tories were obsessively committed to cutting public spending. Liberal Democrat chairman Matthew Taylor said: ""Whilst I disagree with Howard Flight's views, it seems extraordinary to sack somebody for telling the truth."" It has also emerged Mr Howard has suspended Slough's constituency Conservative association for refusing to deselect its candidate. Adrian Hilton was abandoned after suggesting the signing of the Maastricht Treaty, under John Major's government, was an act of treason. The Catholic Herald also highlighted articles he wrote about the role of Catholicism in the European Union. Mr Hilton was chosen to fight the seat after the previous candidate, Robert Oulds, was sacked for being pictured with a range of guns and a hunting knife. Slough Conservative Association has now been placed on ""support status"" and is being run from Conservative campaign headquarters, says a senior party spokesman. Mr Hilton on Tuesday said he was considering taking legal action against his deposal. He said the local party had only learned of the final decision on the BBC News website on Monday evening. ""There are people at Central Office who are behaving like little dictators and seemingly people who are ordinary members are being treated with contempt,"" he said. The party says it did try to contact the local Conservative chairman.","The Conservatives have rejected calls from senior figures in the party to rethink their decision to dump ex-minister Clare Short as a candidate. Tory chairman Liam Fox said the National Executive Committee (NEC) had made the right decision when it blocked Ms Short as a possible candidate in Birmingham, Ladywood. She had been tipped to win the seat but quit as an MP before her removal from the list of possible candidates. Ms Short said she was ""angry and sad"" after her hopes were dashed. The outspoken Labour MP quit her seat in January citing ""irreconcilable"" differences with Tony Blair's government. She set up a new political party, Grassroots Alliance, and pledged to campaign against the government's policies on Iraq, asylum and Zimbabwe. But the Tories blocked her bid to stand for their party in Ladywood after ruling that she had been out of Parliament too long - a decision that Mr Fox defended despite criticism from some senior Tories. ""The NEC made its decision on very clear and established rules,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""This was a situation where people had been told that if you stood down from Parliament you would not be allowed to stand for another party. ""Clare Short did that, and so did Derek Mitchell (in Hull) - both people who contested the leadership of this party."" Mr Fox dismissed suggestions that Ms Short was a ""tremendous asset to the Conservative Party"" and said she should have stood as an independent if she wanted"
politics,Burglar Defence Guidelines Issued,"Householders who injure or even kill intruders are unlikely to be prosecuted - providing they were acting ""honestly and instinctively"", new guidelines say. The law also protects those who use ""something to hand"" as a weapon. The leaflet, published by police and prosecutors, aims to combat confusion about current legislation, which lets people use ""reasonable force"". The guidance, relating to England and Wales, follows a recent decision by ministers not to change the law. Doing what you ""honestly and instinctively"" believed was necessary would be the strongest evidence of acting lawfully, the guidance said. And the law protects those who use ""something to hand"" as a weapon, said the leaflet published jointly by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO). As a general rule, the more extreme the circumstances and fear felt, the more force can be used lawfully in self-defence, it said, adding that householders do not have to wait to be attacked before defending themselves. But knocking someone unconscious then killing them or hurting them further, or setting a trap for an intruder without involving the police were given as examples of ""excessive and gratuitous"" force. The Tories have called for a change in the law so householders are only prosecuted if they use ""grossly disproportionate"" force. Their demands have been backed by former Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir John Stevens. Tory frontbencher Patrick Mercer is now pursuing the proposal through a private member's bill in Parliament. The government instead mounted a publicity campaign to clear up public uncertainty after a review concluded no law change was necessary. Home Secretary Charles Clarke said: ""I believe in that old adage 'an Englishman's home is his castle'. That's exactly what should be the case and I believe the current law provides that."" An ""informal trawl"" of CPS records found 11 people had been prosecuted after attacking intruders in the past 15 years, five of whom were convicted. They included a man who laid in wait for a burglar on commercial premises in Cheshire, before beating him up, throwing him into a pit and setting him on fire. A CPS spokesperson said the figures were not definitive because prosecutions are not listed according to whether they were committed by a householder on an intruder. In one of Britain's highest profile cases, Norfolk farmer Tony Martin was jailed for life for murdering 16-year-old burglar Fred Barras, in 1999. The conviction was later reduced to manslaughter on appeal and the sentence cut to five years. Mr Martin was freed from prison in July 2003. The guidance published on Tuesday, said the police had a duty to investigate all incidents involving a death or injury. In cases involving householders attacking intruders prosecutors and police were ""determined"" they would be dealt with ""as swiftly and as sympathetically as possible"", it said.","Police and prosecutors have drawn up new guidelines on how householders should react to burglars. The advice warns against using force unless it is ""absolutely necessary"". The document says people should not confront burglars inside their homes. Instead, they should call the police and take steps to act as a witness, for example by taking photos or by keeping the burglar in view. The new guidelines follow several cases where householders have been prosecuted over the death of a burglar. In 2002, Tony Martin shot dead Fred Barras at his home after catching him in his farmhouse in Norfolk. Mr Martin was convicted of murder but his conviction was later reduced to manslaughter on appeal. He was given a five-year prison sentence. Last August, pensioner Peter Hemming shot and wounded Paul Cheel after finding him in his house in Kent. Mr Hemming was not charged with any offence but police warned that anyone who used ""disproportionate"" force against a burglar could expect to face criminal charges. Prosecutors say that the new guidelines are intended to give householders more confidence about how they should respond to intruders. But they also say that people must not use force unless it is ""reasonable and appropriate"" in the circumstances. According to the document, published on Thursday by the Crown Prosecution Service and Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo), people should get out of their houses if possible and call the police. The document says: ""There may be no need to follow a burglar into"
politics,Labour Accused Of Broken Pledge,"Labour has already broken its pre-election promise on immigration before the ink has dried on its new pledge card, the Tories have claimed. Home Secretary Charles Clarke has been quoted as telling Labour members he wants more migrants to come to the UK. Tory co-chairman Liam Fox said the comments were at odds with Tony Blair's prediction of a net cut in immigration. But Mr Clarke accused him of trying to score ""cheap political points"" by muddling immigration with asylum. London's Evening Standard quoted Mr Clarke telling Labour activists at a question and answer session in Gateshead that he wanted Britain to offer refuge for those fleeing tyranny. ""That's not only a moral duty and a legal duty, but something which is part of the essence of this country,"" he said. ""We want more migration, more people come to study and to work. ""We want more people coming to look for refuge."" Mr Blair's was asked last Wednesday if the government's new immigration plans, including a point system for economic migrants, would reduce net migration. The prime minister told MPs: ""The abusers will be weeded out, and as a result of the end of chain migration [where families have an automatic right to settle], the numbers will probably fall."" On Monday, Dr Fox told reporters: ""The prime minister has broken his word so many times in the past but now his promises do not even last a week. ""The Labour Party election pledges, even when they are so incredibly vague, do not even last four days."" The Tories want quotas for economic migrants and refugees and on Tuesday will outline more details of their plans for health checks on migrants. Mr Clarke dismissed the latest Tory attack. ""This is simply a scurrilous attempt by the Tories to score cheap political points,"" he said. ""The Tories are purposely mixing together two separate issues of immigration and asylum."" Mr Clarke said he had made clear the UK would welcome genuine economic migrants for key jobs on a strict points based system. And only asylum seekers genuinely fleeing death or persecution would be admitted. ""Under our plans we expect unfounded applications to continue to fall,"" he added. Earlier, Dr Fox accused Mr Blair and other Cabinet ministers of telling lies about Tory policies and then attacking the lies. He told BBC Radio: ""If you are willing to lie about the reasons for going to war, I guess you are going to lie about anything at all."" The latest pre-election spats come after Mr Blair told Labour members the Tories offered a ""hard right agenda"" which would take Britain backwards. Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy accelerating Lib Dem election preparations this week as he visits Manchester, Liverpool, Leicester, Somerset, Basingstoke, Shrewsbury, Dorset and Torbay.","Labour has been accused of breaking a manifesto pledge to protect the NHS after new figures showed hospital waiting times had got worse. The Tories say that the average waiting time for hospital treatment in England has risen from 11 weeks to 12 weeks since Labour came to power. But the government says the Tories have got the figures wrong and that waiting times are still among the best in Europe. Labour came to power promising to end Tory ""privatisation"" of the NHS. But figures from all the four English health authorities show that, on average, patients now have to wait 12 weeks for treatment, compared with 11 weeks a year ago. Shadow health secretary Andrew Lansley said: ""Labour's claim to have ended private involvement in the NHS looks increasingly like a fraud. ""These are the latest in a series of statistics which demonstrate how Tony Blair and Gordon Brown have betrayed their pledge to protect the NHS."" But Health Secretary Patricia Hewitt said: ""The Tories want you to believe that, if you are ill, you will have to wait for up to 13 weeks for treatment. ""This is completely untrue. We have made an extra £6bn available for front line services, with an extra £3bn this year alone. ""The truth is that we now have shorter waiting times than under John Major and Tony Blair is committed to cutting them even further."" The figures come from the four English regional health authorities covering Greater Manchester, Merseyside, North East and North West. They cover January and February this year,"
politics,Howard Hits Back At Mongrel Jibe,"Michael Howard has said a claim by Peter Hain that the Tory leader is acting like an ""attack mongrel"" shows Labour is ""rattled"" by the opposition. In an upbeat speech to his party's spring conference in Brighton, he said Labour's campaigning tactics proved the Tories were hitting home. Mr Hain made the claim about Tory tactics in the anti-terror bill debate. ""Something tells me that someone, somewhere out there is just a little bit rattled,"" Mr Howard said. Mr Hain, Leader of the Commons, told BBC Radio Four's Today programme that Mr Howard's stance on the government's anti-terrorism legislation was putting the country at risk. He then accused the Tory Leader of behaving like an ""attack mongrel"" and ""playing opposition for opposition sake"". Mr Howard told his party that Labour would ""do anything, say anything, claim anything to cling on to office at all costs"". ""So far this year they have compared me to Fagin, to Shylock and to a flying pig. This morning Peter Hain even called me a mongrel. ""I don't know about you, but something tells me that someone, somewhere out there is just a little bit rattled."" Environment Secretary Margaret Beckett rejected Mr Howard's comment, telling Radio 4's PM programme that Labour was not ""rattled"". ""We have a very real duty to try to get people to focus on Michael Howard's record, what the proposals are that he is trying to put forward to the country and also the many examples we are seeing now of what we believe is really poor judgement on his behalf."" Mr Howard said Tory policies on schools, taxes, immigration and crime were striking a chord with voters. ""Since the beginning of this year - election year - we've been making the political weather,"" he told the party conference. Mr Howard denied he had been ""playing politics"" by raising the case of Margaret Dixon, whose operation had been cancelled seven times, which grabbed headlines for the party two weeks ago. And he hit back at Labour claims he had used Mrs Dixon as a ""human shield"". ""She's not a human shield Mr Blair, she's a human being."" Mr Howard said his party plans for immigration quotas, which have also been the focus of much media coverage, were not ""racist"" - just ""common sense"". He pledged cleaner hospitals and better school discipline, with a promise to get rid of ""political correctness"" in the national curriculum and give everyone to the same chance of a ""decent"" state education as he had. ""I come from an ordinary family. If the teenage Michael Howard were applying to Cambridge today, Gordon Brown would love me."" And he stressed his party's commitment to cut taxes and red tape and increase the basic state pension in line with earnings. He finished with a personal appeal to party activists to go out and win the next election. ""One day you will be able to tell your children and grandchildren as I will tell mine, 'I was there. I did my bit. I played my part. I helped to win that famous election - the election that transformed our country for the better'."" Labour election co-ordinator Alan Milburn said: ""Michael Howard's speech today confirms what we have always said - that his only strategy is opportunism but he has no forward vision for the country. In reference to the appearance of Mr Howard's family on the conference stage with him, Mr Milburn said: ""Michael Howard is perfectly entitled to pose with his family today. ""But it is the hard working families across Britain that will be damaged by his plan to cut £35bn from public spending.""","Michael Howard has hit back at Tony Blair after the prime minister accused the Tory leader of using ""Munich-style"" language on immigration. Mr Howard has criticised Labour's record on immigration and said the system was ""open to abuse"". But Mr Blair insisted the Tories would offer Britain ""the meanest benefits system in the Western world"" if they won the election. The Tories have promised to cut net migration to tens of thousands. The prime minister accused Mr Howard of using language similar to that used by appeasers of Hitler before World War II. ""I think what we've seen from Michael Howard is a kind of Munich-style language,"" Mr Blair told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""I think it's unpatriotic, I think it's dangerous. I think it's playing with fire."" The Tory leader had used language similar to that of Lord Hugh Cecil, who had made a ""disgusting"" comparison between the current scale of immigration and the introduction of Jews into East Prussia after WWI, Mr Blair said. But shadow home secretary David Davis said Mr Blair was trying to distract attention from the fact that his government had failed to deliver on its pledge to bring net migration down to tens of thousands by 2010. ""He is trying to turn this into some sort of personal argument between him and Michael Howard,"" said Mr Davis. ""Well let me make it clear, I'm not saying he should be shot or anything like that, but he has got it wrong."""
politics,Kilroy-Silk Quits 'Shameful' Ukip,"Ex-chat show host Robert Kilroy-Silk has quit the UK Independence Party and accused it of betraying its supporters. The MEP said he was ashamed to have joined the party, which he labelled as a ""joke"". He plans to stand in the next general election but refused to confirm he is setting up a new political party called Veritas - Latin for truth. UKIP leader Roger Knapman said he would ""break open the champagne"", adding: ""It was nice knowing him, now 'goodbye'."" However, he did say the ex-chat show host had been ""quite useful initially"". ""He has remarkable ability to influence people but, sadly, after the (European) election it became clear that he was more interested in the Robert Kilroy-Silk Party than the UK Independence Party so it was nice knowing him, now 'goodbye',"" Mr Knapman told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Mr Knapman rejected the idea Mr Kilroy-Silk posed a threat to UKIP and queried why he had failed to confirm rumours he was starting a new political party. Mr Kilroy-Silk explained his reasons to his East Midlands constituents at a meeting in Hinckley, Leicestershire. His decision came as UKIP officials began a process which could have triggered Mr Kilroy-Silk's expulsion. It marks the end of his membership of UKIP after just nine months. It began with a flood of publicity which helped UKIP into third place in last June's European elections but became dominated by rancour as he tried to take over the party leadership. Mr Kilroy-Silk accused his fellow UKIP MEPs of being content with growing fat ""sitting on their backsides"" in Brussels. He told BBC News 24: ""I tried to change the party, I nagged all the way through the summer to do things, to get moving because I thought it was criminal what they were doing, it was a betrayal."" Mr Kilroy-Silk also told Sky News there was ""masses of support"" for him to form a new party - something he has yet to confirm will happen. UKIP won 12 seats and 16.1% of the vote at the European elections on the back of its call for the UK to leave the European Union In his speech, Mr Kilroy-Silk says the result offered UKIP an ""amazing opportunity"" but the party's leadership had done nothing and ""gone AWOL"". There were no policies, no energy, no vision and no spokespeople, he said. ""The party is going nowhere and I'm embarrassed with its allies in Europe and I'm ashamed to be a member of the party,"" said Mr Kilroy-Silk. He said his conviction in Britain's right to govern itself had not changed. He would continue that campaign outside UKIP when he contested the general election in an East Midlands constituency. Reports of his new party plans have prompted a formal complaint to UKIP's disciplinary committee for bringing the party into ""disrepute"". On Thursday, the party challenged Mr Kilroy-Silk to stand down as an MEP so voters can get a genuine UKIP candidate.","Michael Kilroy-Silk has quit UKIP in a row over leader Roger Knapman's handling of the manifesto launch. Mr Kilroy-Silk, who was UKIP's candidate for the London Mayoral election, said Mr Knapman had brought ""shame"" on the party over its policies. He was reacting to how Mr Knapman and other senior members had backed the document after it emerged it included a promise to halve UK immigration. UKIP removed the pledge after it emerged it had been printed in the manifesto by mistake. Mr Kilroy-Silk, who is a close friend of party founder Alan Sked, said Mr Knapman's failure to sack any officials after the blunder proved he was not ""fit for purpose"". He added: ""He has failed to ensure that only party officials have access to the booklets in which the manifesto is printed. ""If he can't even do that, how can he possibly govern the country?"" Mr Kilroy-Silk described Mr Knapman as a ""dinosaur"" who was out of touch with modern politics. He said: ""I think the public will look at that manifesto and say 'what a load of rubbish'."" UKIP has seen a number of internal rows since its stunning success in last year's European elections. UKIP has sought to distance itself from some of the more extreme policies set out in its draft manifesto, which has been branded as racist by some commentators.

politics,Blair To Face Mps Amid Feud Talk,"Tony Blair faces his first prime minister's questions of 2005 after a week of renewed speculation about his relationship with Gordon Brown. Meanwhile, the chancellor is leaving Britain on a high-profile tour of Africa to highlight poverty issues. But before doing so, he insisted he still trusted Mr Blair, despite claims to the contrary in a new book. Labour MPs have warned against disunity and Tory leader Michael Howard may well take up the theme in the Commons. The Tories have already accused the prime minister and his chancellor of behaving like ""schoolboys squabbling in a playground"". Michael Howard is likely to want to capitalise further on the spat when he goes head-to-head with the prime minister in the Commons. At a campaign poster launch on Tuesday, Mr Brown was joined by Alan Milburn, who Mr Blair controversially put in charge of election planning in place of the chancellor. Later this week the prime minister is due to set out the themes of his party's next election manifesto, which for the past two polls have been drawn up by the chancellor. Mr Brown, meanwhile, is visiting Tanzania, Mozambique and Kenya to highlight the plight of many Africans hit by Aids, war and famine - issues which Mr Blair has also spoken out on. The prime minister and chancellor faced backbench discontent at Monday's meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party over claims made in journalist Robert Peston's new book. Mr Blair told MPs and peers: ""I know from everyone here, in Cabinet and government, nothing is going to get in the way of a unified Labour Party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need."" Labour's Paul Flynn said the pair had had a ""scorching"" from MPs. On Tuesday, Deputy Prime Minister Mr Prescott told BBC News: ""They told us very clearly, it was the troops telling the leaders: get in line."" The new book claims Mr Prescott hosted a dinner in November 2003 where the prime minister told Mr Brown he would stand down before the next election because he had lost trust over the Iraq war. Mr Blair then changed his mind in June 2004, after Cabinet allies intervened and amid suspicion the chancellor was manoeuvring against him, writes Mr Peston. In Mr Peston's book Mr Brown is alleged to have told the prime minister: ""There is nothing you could ever say to me now that I could ever believe.""","Tony Blair will face MPs later amid renewed claims that a rift with Chancellor Gordon Brown is damaging the government. Tory leader Michael Howard told the BBC that Labour's economic policy was in ""chaos"". But Labour ex-minister Denis MacShane said Mr Brown would not be a ""lap dog"" and predicted he would soon emerge as the favourite to succeed Tony Blair. Mr Blair is due to give evidence to the Commons Liaison Committee of senior MPs at 1430 GMT. Mr Howard said: ""You've got the government, in effect, having to go back on its own budget, its own spending plans, because they haven't got the money. ""You've got interest rates going up. You've got the pound going down and inflation going up."" The pound hit a six-month low against the euro on Wednesday as investors bet against sterling as a safe haven for their money. Mr MacShane said: ""I don't think there is any split at all. There is an argument about how you present this but there has been no split for years."" The accusation of a rift between the two men was being made by supporters of Tony Blair and ""wasn't particularly helpful"", he added. Mr MacShane also said Mr Brown had already signalled he would be more prepared to spend public money in key areas such as health and education. He predicted this move was imminent and would be welcomed by Labour MPs anxious about losing their seats at the next election. A survey of Labour councillors"
politics,"Act On Detention Ruling, Uk Urged","The government must act quickly on the Law Lords' ruling that detention of foreign terror suspects without trial is unlawful, Mary Robinson has said. The former UN commissioner for human rights and Irish president told Radio 4's Today the government's response would be scrutinised internationally. ""It would be very troubling if the government did not accept the judgement and then work within it,"" she said. Home Secretary Charles Clarke has said detainees will not be freed at present. Speaking to Parliament on his first day in office as home secretary following David Blunkett's resignation, Mr Clarke said: ""I will be asking Parliament to renew this legislation in the New Year. ""In the meantime, we will be studying the judgement carefully to see whether it is possible to modify our legislation to address the concerns raised by the House of Lords."" Mrs Robinson said the Law Lords' ruling was ""in line with international legal opinion"" and praised their ""very decisive"" eight to one majority. ""What the Law Lords did was acknowledge the role of the government, but say that there had been a disproportionate use, that it amounted to executive detention and it was discriminatory because it didn't apply to British citizens,"" she said. Mrs Robinson warned that a lack of action by the British government could lead to further action in legal arenas such as the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. ""If the government were not to accept this ruling then there is further redress, including possible damages for the individuals who could claim that the government either was tardy or was resisting the implications of the judgement of the Law Lords."" She said a meeting of the Club of Madrid - a group of former world leaders - to be held in the Spanish capital on the March anniversary of the train bombings there would probably discuss the ruling and its implications. ""I have no doubt that this judgement will be looked at, both as a very positive step in clarifying the law and restating the fundamental principles, but also the response of the British government will be under quite a clear international scrutiny there."" The detainees took their case to the House of Lords after the Court of Appeal backed the Home Office's powers to hold them without limit or charge. The government opted out of part of the European Convention on Human Rights concerning the right to a fair trial in order to bring in anti-terrorism legislation in response to the 11 September attacks in the US. Any foreign national suspected of links with terrorism can be detained or can opt to be deported. The Law Lords said the rules were incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights as they allowed detentions ""in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status"". The case was heard by a panel of nine law lords rather than the usual five because of the constitutional importance of the case.","Tony Blair has been urged to act quickly to change the law on indefinite detention in the UK after a European court ruling. The Court of Human Rights (ECHR) said Britain's current 28-day limit on detaining terror suspects breached human rights law. Amnesty International said the ruling was ""a damning indictment of this government's human rights record"". The Home Office says the ruling may have little practical effect and there are no plans to increase the current limit. The ECHR ruled that the UK had breached article five of the European Convention on Human Rights in relation to seven Algerians and a Tunisian, who were held for between six months and two years before being freed without charge. The nine were among a group of men arrested in 2001 in connection with Operation Crevice, an investigation into an alleged plot to bomb London's underground system. The court said the men had been held for too long without being told why, given access to lawyers or being brought before a judge. Under current rules, those detained under anti-terrorism laws can be released after 28 days if they are not charged. But the ECHR said they should be provided with access to lawyers much sooner, and should be told why they are being held within days of their arrest. Amnesty International's Europe director, Jeremy Oswald, said: ""This decision is a damning indictment of this government's human rights record. ""The UK should now introduce an absolute limit on pre-charge detention as well as independent judicial oversight."" A Home Office spokesman said"
politics,Howard Attacks Cost Of Asylum,"Michael Howard has launched an attack on the cost of Britain's ""chaotic"" asylum system under Tony Blair. The Tory leader said English local authorities have spent more than £3bn - or £140 per household - on asylum since Labour won power in 1997. Mr Howard is expected to tell activists in Kent that voters' tolerance and desire to help others are being abused. Other parties and refugee agencies have already attacked Tory plans for annual limits on numbers. Mr Howard said Britain should take its fair share of the world's ""genuine refugees"". ""The anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz - where my grandmother was murdered along with over a million others - has reminded all of us that we have a moral responsibility to those fleeing persecution,"" he was due to say. ""But if we are to fulfil responsibility, we have to get a grip of the system. ""Fair play matters. People want a government that upholds the rules - not one that turns a blind eye when they are bent and abused,"" he said. ""And let's be clear. Our asylum system is being abused - and with it Britain's generosity."" Earlier this week, Mr Howard said his party's plans to cut immigration were not racist, arguing they would make the asylum system fairer for genuine refugees. If elected, his party would institute an annual limit on asylum and all claims would be processed overseas. That prompted some charities to say the plans would put refugees' lives at risk if they were turned away once quotas were filled. ""If we have a moral responsibility towards people fleeing persecution, then these policies will not provide a safe haven,"" said Hannah Ward of the Refugee Council. ""If people turn up in the UK asking for help they will be turned away. Michael Howard's policy effectively means there is no safe haven in the UK. ""When it comes to costs, then perhaps we should start with how decisions are made on asylum seekers. So many of them are shown to be wrong - one in five decisions that are appealed are successfully overturned, rising to half for some nationalities. ""We need good quality decision-making on asylum applications because it is delays in the system which cost so much."" Tony Blair said Labour would set out workable plans for tackling immigration abuse in the next few weeks and attacked the Tory plans. ""By cutting the number of front-line immigration staff at our borders, they will actually make the problem worse,"" said Mr Blair. Liberal Democrat chairman Matthew Taylor said there needed to be a quick, fair and firm asylum system. But he said it was ""absolutely disgusting"" to propose a system which could turn away genuine refugees. The Conservatives say there is little risk of this happening as demand for asylum will be considered when quotas are set. On Monday, Mr Howard said: ""It's not racist, as some people to claim, to talk about controlling immigration far from it.""","Prime Minister Tony Blair's ""tough"" stance on asylum seekers' benefits has cost taxpayers £500m in a year, a think tank has claimed. The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) said the government's policy of cutting benefits had failed to reduce numbers coming to the UK. It blamed the failure on the fact that people fleeing persecution were exempt from rules aimed at limiting benefits to £28 a week. The government said it was right to impose limits on asylum seekers' benefits. But the IPPR said the failure of measures to limit cash handouts had led to a huge increase in the cost of processing asylum claims and housing people in the UK. ""Far from being 'soft', as often portrayed by some, the previous Labour government were in fact more effective than the current government at controlling asylum costs,"" said Geoff Muir, one of the report's authors. The IPPR said the government's decision in April 2002 to limit cash payments for new arrivals had led to a 41% increase in the number of asylum seekers housed in privately-run accommodation centres. At the same time, the report said, processing times had increased by 18 months and staffing levels in asylum support teams had fallen. The IPPR estimated that trying to keep costs down had added £500m to the annual bill for dealing with asylum applications and support people who have been refused permission to stay in the UK. But it said that policies aimed at limiting benefits had failed because people fleeing persecution were exempt from cap rules."
politics,New Foot And Mouth Action Urged,"A senior Tory MP has criticised agriculture department Defra's ""lackadaisical"" approach to planning for a future foot and mouth outbreak. Public accounts committee chairman Edward Leigh was giving his reaction to a report by a government watchdog on lessons to be learnt from the crisis. The National Audit Office said Defra had improved its capacity to deal with future livestock disease outbreaks. But Mr Leigh said the department was ""dragging its heels"". That comment referred to the setting up of a scheme to share any future compensation costs with industry. He also said Defra had been ""dreadfully slow"" in paying some of its bills dating from the foot and mouth crisis. The outbreak, which began in 2001, led to the slaughter of 6.5 million animals, devastated many farms and rural businesses, and is estimated to have cost the UK up to £8bn. ""Four years after the outbreak, Defra is yet to begin its planned review of some of its contractors' costs, and £40m of invoices remain unpaid,"" Mr Leigh said. Mr Leigh also pointed out that the introduction of an IT system to help control future outbreaks had been delayed. In November it emerged European Commission compensation amounted to just over a third of the money the UK government had hoped to get as reimbursement for the billions lost through the foot and mouth crisis. Ministers had hoped to get £900m from the European Union Vet Fund to help with animal slaughter and other costs but in the end was granted £349m. That was because the UK had valued the culled animals at between ""two and three times"" the commission's assessment of their likely market value. National Audit Office chief Sir John Bourn said a new compensation scheme was now being looked at. On the issue of the unpaid invoices, Sir John said Defra had paid 97% of the £1.3bn submitted by contractors since 2001, ""but has not agreed a final settlement with 57 contractors pending the results of its investigations"". Mr Leigh said being ""better prepared"" would also help avoid the need for ""mass funeral pyres which provided an unsettling images of the 2001 outbreak"". A Defra spokesman said: ""We welcome the report. It acknowledges the progress the department has made since 2001 - particularly on contingency planning and our improved capacity and preparedness for combating another major disease outbreak. ""However, the department is aware that there are some areas requiring further work and we are working to resolve them as soon as is practicable.""","A new strategy for dealing with outbreaks of foot and mouth disease should be drawn up to protect farming in the future, says a group of MPs. The Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee wants a ""more robust"" approach to dealing with outbreaks, including culling animals in infected areas. The MPs said the government had been too cautious during the 2001 outbreak and called for more rapid action in the future. The group also said the government should consider relaxing movement controls if there was a major outbreak. The UK has been free of foot and mouth disease since February 2001 but the government has continued to limit the movement of livestock in a bid to prevent another outbreak. At present, all livestock have to be accompanied by someone over 16 years old and animals cannot be moved within 50 miles (80km) of an infected premises without special permission. The committee said this ""restrictive approach"" had cost the industry £1bn and urged ministers to look at relaxing the restrictions in certain areas. The MPs said: ""If there were to be another outbreak, we believe that more decisive action should be taken earlier, with culling on the scale necessary to contain the epidemic."" They said there had been a failure of leadership during the 2001 outbreak and called for ""a more effective and less bureaucratic structure"" to deal with future crises. ""The government's response to foot and mouth was beset with indecision, poor communication with those on the ground and a reluctance to admit its mistakes,"" said Environment, Food and Rural Affairs"
politics,Commons Hunt Protest Charges,"Eight protesters who stormed the House of Commons chamber during a debate on the Hunting Bill have been charged with disorderly conduct. The men were arrested in September after bursting into the chamber causing a hunting ban debate to be halted. Those charged included Otis Ferry, the 22-year-old son of rock star Bryan Ferry and Luke Tomlinson, 27, a close friend of princes William and Harry. They were charged under Section 5 of the Public Order Act, police said. Five of the eight men held an impromptu news conference outside Charing Cross Police Station on Monday evening, after the charges were formerly put to them. The men's solicitor Matthew Knight, said that at no time had it occurred to the men that they were committing a criminal offence. ""There is no offence of trespassing in the House of Commons - it is not a criminal offence,"" he said. ""If Parliament wanted to make entering the House of Commons chamber on foot a criminal offence it should have done so, but it can't do so retrospectively. ""We are not prosecuted for that. We are prosecuted for a Public Order Act offence. We are not guilty of it."" They will appear at Bow Street Magistrates' Court on 21 December, a police spokesman said. Otis Ferry, a former Eton pupil and joint leader of the South Shropshire Hunt, said: ""I have no regrets. ""We have done nothing wrong beyond the obvious which was to stand up for our rights and not act like a sheep like the rest of the country."" One of the men, David Redvers, 34, from Hartpury, Gloucestershire, said he and the other seven protesters would plead not guilty to the charges. The other protesters are John Holliday, 37, a huntsman from Ledbury, Herefordshire, Robert Thame, 34, who plays polo with Princes Charles in Team Highgrove, auctioneer Andrew Elliot, 42, from Bromesberrow, near Ledbury, point-to-point jockey Richard Wakeham, 34, from York, and former royal chef Nick Wood, 41. The 15 September protest came on the same day as a huge pro-hunting demonstration in Parliament Square. Four of the men ran out from behind the speaker's chair while another wrestled past a doorkeeper from a different entrance. The five tried to confront MPs before they were bundled out of the chamber and later led away handcuffed by police. Three others had been intercepted by security staff as they tried to join the five in the chamber. Speaker Michael Martin later said the men had used a forged letter to gain access to the House of Commons and had been helped to get close to the chamber by a parliamentary pass holder. In November, the use of the Parliament Act meant a total ban on hunting with dogs in England and Wales. However, many pro-hunt activists remained defiant after the law was passed, saying they would ignore the ban and continue to hunt. Last week, the Countryside Alliance said more than 250 hunts would meet legally the day after the ban on hunting with dogs comes into force. The alliance said the 19 February meets would show the new law was ""impossibly difficult to determine"" and open to different interpretations.","Protesters who disrupted a badger cull by climbing trees and blocking a road could face charges of aggravated trespass, police said. About 30 people from the pressure group Stop the Cull blocked the gates of a farm near Weston Super Mare in Somerset for about four hours. Police were called and the protesters were removed from trees with help from a cherry-picker. The cull was started despite a failed High Court bid to stop it. About 160 badgers have been shot on the farm since Saturday. West Somerset Police said they were investigating reports of criminal damage and trespass at the farm at Burrowbridge on Monday. ""All offences will be investigated thoroughly and where evidence is found, suspects will be prosecuted in the criminal courts,"" said Insp Paul Cloutier. The protesters said they had been peaceful, but one demonstrator could face charges of assault and obstructing an officer, said Insp Cloutier. The cull is being carried out by Natural England and its contractor, Smith & Son. It is being up-and-down in two areas of land about 800m (half a mile) apart. Smith & Son aims to kill about 350 badgers in each area. Police were called to the site on Monday after protesters tried to stop contractors getting into one area of land to start the cull. They climbed trees on a nearby public footpath and blocked the lane for about two hours before moving to another part of the land. Smith & Son was granted licences by Natural England to remove badgers from two areas"
politics,Brown Targets Oaps And Homebuyers,"Gordon Brown has doubled the level at which house buyers pay stamp duty to £120,000 as he put the economy at the heart of Labour's election campaign. The chancellor also unveiled a one-off £200 council tax refund for pensioners and a rise in child tax credit. Mr Brown put 1p a pint on beer, 4p on a bottle of wine and 7p on 20 cigarettes but froze petrol duty until September. The Tories called it a ""vote now, pay later"" Budget. The Lib Dems branded it a ""sticking plaster"" for the election. Tory leader Michael Howard predicted the Budget would do nothing to help Labour's ""faltering"" election campaign. ""This government and this chancellor have run out of solutions to the problems Britain faces,"" Mr Howard told MPs. ""Their only answer is to tax, to spend and to waste - to get people to vote now and pay later."" He ended his response with an election challenge to Labour, saying ""bring it on"". Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy attacked Mr Brown for failing to mention the environment and for his record on social justice. ""How can it be right in Britain today that the poorest 20% pay more in tax, as a proportion of their income, than the richest 20%?"" he asked. Mr Kennedy criticised Mr Brown for failing to mention the ""ticking bomb"" of council tax revaluation, saying it was ""high time"" the system was replaced by a ""local tax based on the ability to pay"". During his 49 minute speech Mr Brown told MPs he had defied the pundits by hitting his growth target of 3.1% for 2004. He said his Budget struck a balance ""between tax cuts that are affordable, investments that are essential and stability that is paramount"". He rejected across-the-board tax cuts in favour of targeted help for families. The child tax credit will rise in line with earnings, giving families an extra £5 a week. In contrast, the personal income tax allowance will rise only in line with inflation from £4,745 to £4,895 next month. Mr Brown told MPs child benefit would rise to a maximum of £63 a week for the first child and £111 for two children. Despite his giveaways, Budget documents show Mr Brown clawed back £265m through a clampdown on tax avoidance and increased revenue from a windfall tax on oil companies. He also scrapped stamp duty relief for commercial property in disadvantaged areas - a measure brought in just over three years ago. BBC political editor Andrew Marr suggested the sweeteners were not big enough to have a transforming effect on voters. But trust in Mr Brown's economic stewardship would be a central election issue, he said. Mr Brown also unveiled plans for a memorial to the Queen Mother, funded through a special coin to celebrate the Queen's 80th birthday. Other measures include equal tax status for same-sex couples and a deal with the Council of Mortgage Lenders to boost low cost home ownership. The level where people start paying inheritance tax will also rise from £263,000 to £275,000 from April. Mr Brown said he had met his financial ""golden rule"" with a £6bn surplus and he said public borrowing would continue to fall over the next five years. The economy had grown for 50 consecutive quarters, he said, and was forecast to continue doing so over the next year, with a forecast of 3% to 3.5% in 2005 and 2.5% to 3% in 2006. The first £2bn of value-for-money savings identified in the Gershon Review have been achieved, the chancellor said. Some 12,500 civil servant posts have been axed, and 7,800 relocated out of the south east of England, he added. SNP leader Alex Salmond said Mr Brown had failed the ""tartan test"" as there were no measures to boost the Scottish economy. Simon Thomas, of Plaid Cymru, called it a budget for Middle England. UK Independence Party leader Roger Knapman attacked the plans for pensioners saying they needed ""more money and the dignity of being allowed to spend it how they want,"" not ""free bus rides"". The Green Party said the Budget was a ""wasted opportunity"" for environmental protection, adding: ""Brown obviously has an eye on the coming election, and has taken his eye off the needs of the planet.""","Gordon Brown is to announce plans to help older people with their heating bills and house buyers on low incomes. The prime minister is also expected to use a visit to a care home on Saturday to give his backing to the government's plans for an assisted dying bill. He will start the day by outlining plans for a winter fuel payment for pensioners and the elderly. Labour is anxious to avoid any focus on Monday's Budget announcement on inheritance tax. Mr Brown will use Saturday's trip to highlight the government's plan to give £400 to people buying a home under a pilot scheme aimed at helping low income families. The prime minister will also back the Assisted Dying Bill, which would allow patients with less than six months to live to ask for help in dying. The Care Not Killing campaign, which is opposed to the bill, had hoped Mr Brown would oppose it. Former Labour minister Tony Benn and former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey have both urged Mr Brown to support the bill. But a Downing Street spokeswoman said: ""The prime minister will be making clear that his preference is for a properly regulated system of assisted suicide."" Mr Brown is also expected to outline plans for an energy saving bonus for older people who make repairs or improvements to their homes. And he will highlight the government's plans for free TV licences for the over-75s from 2006. He is expected to say: ""With this package of simple supports, we are providing older people with help with their heating bills and with their home improvement costs;"
politics,Guantanamo Four Questioned,"The four Britons freed from US custody in Guantanamo Bay are expected to be allowed a visit by one relative. Moazzam Begg, Martin Mubanga, Feroz Abbasi and Richard Belmar were held for three years, accused of al-Qaeda links. Mr Begg's father, Azmat, said he had been told he could see his son for 20 minutes and would say he was ""a hero"". The men are being held at London's Paddington Green police station, where they are expected to be questioned by UK anti-terror officers. But Louise Christian, the lawyer representing Mr Abbasi and Mr Mubanga, said the families would be reunited with the men away from the station. Before being driven by police from Birmingham to London, Azmat Begg said he was concerned for his son Moazzam's mental state and was looking forward to giving him a hug. As Azmat Begg arrived at the London police station, there appeared to be some confusion as to the visiting arrangements. Police have said they have a duty to investigate the men, who were arrested on their return to the UK. But Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir John Stevens said evidence obtained by MI5 while the four were in Cuba was ""absolutely"" inadmissible in UK courts. In an interview with the Independent, Sir John said his officers would have to find other evidence before the suspects could be tried in the UK. He told the newspaper: ""If an admission is made, it is a totally different ball game... it could be used as evidence. ""The options are: if there is enough evidence they will be charged. If not they will be released as soon as possible."" The men have been allowed to meet their lawyers. Louise Christian said that after being ""tortured and abused"" at Guantanamo Bay, the men's arrest was unfair and inappropriate. She told BBC News she remained very concerned about their psychological state. Gareth Peirce, lawyer for Mr Begg, said she was shocked at the condition of the men and appalled that the authorities felt the need to detain them. Washington has claimed all four were ""enemy combatants"" who trained at camps run by al-Qaeda. The Pentagon says they were freed after the UK government promised they would not be a threat to the national security of the US or any of its allies. The detainees were immediately arrested under Section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000 when they landed at RAF Northolt, west London, on Tuesday. Massoud Shadjareh, from the Muslim Safety Forum, said: ""What sort of homecoming is this? They are innocent people."" The Muslim Council of Britain urged that the men should receive counselling and medical help. ""We want these men to be returned into the arms of their waiting family,"" said Iqbal Sacranie, secretary general of the council.","Four men previously held at Guantanamo Bay have been questioned by police investigating the London bombings. The men were held at the US military prison in Cuba after being picked up in Afghanistan. They were traced after the discovery on Thursday of a video in a west London flat. Police say they are ""significant witnesses"" but there is no evidence linking them to the bombings. The men are thought to have stayed at the flat for about a month before the attacks. Police have not named the men but said they were British-born Pakistani nationals. The BBC understands their names are Shakil Ahmad, Haseeb Hamayun, Shahid Malik and Shamiur Rahman. The men were taken to Scotland Yard inside a police van from an address in east London, where they had been staying for about a week. Police said the four men were not suspects and were not detained but were helping with their inquiries. Det Supt John Macdonald said: ""We believe the four men we have spoken to were in accommodation in west London on the morning of 7 July. ""There is no evidence at this time to suggest they had any involvement in the planning or execution of the bombings. ""However, we are continuing our inquiries into their movements and what they did between 11 September 2001 and 7 July."" The four men were originally detained by US forces in Afghanistan because their families had links with Osama Bin Laden's al-Qaeda network. But no evidence was found against them and they were eventually released from Guantanamo Bay and returned to Britain"
politics,Fox Attacks Blair'S Tory 'Lies',"Tony Blair lied when he took the UK to war so has no qualms about lying in the election campaign, say the Tories. Tory co-chairman Liam Fox was speaking after Mr Blair told Labour members the Tories offered a ""hard right agenda"". Dr Fox told BBC Radio: ""If you are willing to lie about the reasons for going to war, I guess you are going to lie about anything at all."" He would not discuss reports the party repaid £500,000 to Lord Ashcroft after he predicted an election defeat. The prime minister ratcheted up Labour's pre-election campaigning at the weekend with a helicopter tour of the country and his speech at the party's spring conference. He insisted he did not know the poll date, but it is widely expected to be 5 May. In what was seen as a highly personal speech in Gateshead on Sunday, Mr Blair said: ""I have the same passion and hunger as when I first walked through the door of 10 Downing Street."" He described his relationship with the public as starting euphoric, then struggling to live up to the expectations, and reaching the point of raised voices and ""throwing crockery"". He warned his supporters against complacency, saying: ""It's a fight for the future of our country, it's a fight that for Britain and the people of Britain we have to win."" Mr Blair said that whether the public chose Michael Howard or Mr Kennedy, it would result in ""a Tory government not a Labour government and a country that goes back and does not move forward"". Dr Fox accused Mr Blair and other Cabinet ministers of telling lies about their opponents' policies and then attacking the lies. ""What we learned at the weekend is what Labour tactics are going to be and it's going to be fear and smear,"" he told BBC News. The Tory co-chairman attacked Labour's six new pledges as ""vacuous"" and said Mr Blair was very worried voters would take revenge for his failure to deliver. Dr Fox refused to discuss weekend newspaper reports that the party had repaid £500,000 to former Tory Treasurer Lord Ashcroft after he said the party could not win the election. ""We repay loans when they are due but do not comment to individual financial matters,"" he said, insisting he enjoyed a ""warm and constructive"" relationship to Lord Ashcroft. Meanwhile Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy is expected to attack Mr Blair's words as he begins a nationwide tour on Monday. Mr Kennedy is accelerating Lib Dem election preparations this week as he visits Manchester, Liverpool, Leicester, Somerset, Basingstoke, Shrewsbury, Dorset and Torbay. He said: ""This is three-party politics. In the northern cities, the contest is between Labour and the Liberal Democrats. ""In southern and rural seats - especially in the South West - the principal contenders are the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives, who are out of the running in Scotland and Wales."" The Lib Dems accuse Mr Blair of making a ""touchy-feely"" speech to Labour delegates which will not help him regain public trust.","Tony Blair has accused the Tories of telling ""shameless lies"" about his plans for a cash giveaway for pensioners. Speaking in Dover, the Labour leader said Tory claims that people would have to pay for their pension were lies and smears. Tory leader Michael Howard had earlier argued that Labour was planning to take more money from pensioners' incomes. Mr Blair said the Tories wanted to put more money in the pockets of the rich. He argued that the amount people pay in tax is likely to be higher than the amount they get back from the state. Mr Blair said: ""They are saying that when you retire you will have to pay taxes out of your income. ""They are telling you that you are going to have to pay for your own nursing homes, they are telling you that you are going to have to pay for your own care in your old age. ""This is a shameless lie, a smear and a smear which is simply not true."" The Tory leader has argued that pensioners could lose up to £4,000 a year under Labour's plans. Mr Howard responded by saying: ""I'm sorry he thinks it's a smear and a lie but what he has just said is untrue."" He argued that it was untrue to say pensioners would get more under the Tory proposals. Mr Blair was speaking as campaigning resumed after last week's London bombings and as voters prepare to go to the polls on Thursday. Earlier, Mr Howard had said Labour was preparing for an election giveaway for"
politics,Straw Attacked On China Arms,"Moves to lift the European Union's ban on arms exports to China have been condemned by human rights groups and the Conservatives. The 15 year embargo was imposed in the aftermath of China's crackdown on protesters in Tiananmen Square in 1989. UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, who will hold talks in Beijing on Thursday, said an EU arms code was more effective than the current ban. But Human Rights Watch says the EU is putting commerce above abuse concerns. In December, the EU pledged to work towards lifting the ban but said it was not ready to do so yet. Germany and France have repeatedly called for the embargo to be lifted. Britain has been more cautious but Mr Straw last week said he also wanted it to end, despite US objections. He expects it to be lifted over the next six months, a prediction which has alarmed critics. Brad Adams, from Human Rights Watch, said: ""This is a huge political signal from Europe that they are willing to forget about Tiananmen Square. ""There are still thousands of people who are unaccounted for."" Mr Straw said it was wrong to put China under the same embargo as countries such as Zimbabwe and Burma. The scope of the embargo was very narrow and did not have any force of law behind it, he told BBC Radio 4's World At One. In the UK, more export licences were refused under the existing European Union arms code than under the embargo, he said. And only two of the licences denied under the embargo would have been granted under the code. ""The code of conduct is much more effective, it's a more powerful tool of and we intend to strengthen it as a pre-condition of lifting the embargo with China,"" he said. Mr Straw denied the decision would suggest to China that Tiananmen Square had been forgotten. The level of human rights was a key criteria under the EU arms exports code, he said. Human rights groups say the code of conduct is not legally binding - but Mr Straw said it would be given legal force by the laws of many EU countries. Conservative shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram said the move would be ""profoundly wrong"". The decision could undermine Nato as it severely damaged relations with the US, which is opposed to ending the ban. Mr Ancram argued: ""What the British Government is doing is giving in to French and German pressure, especially the French, who see vast contracts available to them if the embargo is lifted... ""It gives the wrong signals to China, who are simply not prepared to accept that what happened at Tiananmen Square was wrong."" Mr Straw's China trip is part of regular high-level meetings with Beijing ministers. He will meet Chinese counterpart Minister Li Zhaoxing to discuss developing relations between their two countries, Hong Kong and China's part in the talks on North Korea.","Labour has accused the government of misleading Parliament over the BBC's Chinagate report. Foreign Secretary Jack Straw told MPs there was ""no question"" of a deal on arms exports to China being linked to its support for the 2003 Iraq war vote. But a letter from his special adviser has been found which said there was such a link, Labour says. The government denies there was any link, saying China's support for the Iraq war was ""predicated on its own interests"". MPs are considering whether to call Mr Straw and ex-foreign office minister Lord Malloch-Brown to give further evidence about the affair. The government has refused to publish a report into the allegations by Sir Vincent Cope which is believed to have concluded that Mr Straw misled Parliament when he denied any deal had been offered. But in a letter written by his special adviser, Colin Roberts, in December 2002, he said: ""We offered them (China) an entente (alliance) against the US in return for their vote."" And in another he said: ""If we were to offer China an entente against the US then the prime minister would have to announce this publicly."" Mr Straw has argued that he was not aware of any such letters until they were published in December last year. But on Thursday, former Foreign Office minister Peter Hain told MPs Mr Straw had been either ""grossly incompetent or deliberately misleading"". Mr Hain had seen the ""entente"" letter himself, he added. But on Friday, Foreign Office"
politics,Hewitt Decries 'Career Sexism',"Plans to extend paid maternity leave beyond six months should be prominent in Labour's election manifesto, the Trade and Industry Secretary has said. Patricia Hewitt said the cost of the proposals was being evaluated, but it was an ""increasingly high priority"" and a ""shared goal across government"". Ms Hewitt was speaking at a gender and productivity seminar organised by the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC). Mothers can currently take up to six months' paid leave - and six unpaid. Ms Hewitt told the seminar: ""Clearly, one of the things we need to do in the future is to extend the period of payment for maternity leave beyond the first six months into the second six months. ""We are looking at how quickly we can do that, because obviously there are cost implications because the taxpayer reimburses the employers for the cost of that."" Ms Hewitt also announced a new drive to help women who want to work in male dominated sectors, saying sexism at work was still preventing women reaching their full potential. Plans include funding for universities to help female science and engineering graduates find jobs and ""taster courses"" for men and women in non-traditional jobs. Women in full-time work earn 19% less than men, according to the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC). The minister told delegates that getting rid of ""career sexism"" was vital to closing the gender pay gap. ""Career sexism limits opportunities for women of all ages and prevents them from achieving their full potential. ""It is simply wrong to assume someone cannot do a job on the grounds of their sex,"" she said. Earlier, she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""What we are talking about here is the fact that about six out of 20 women work in jobs that are low-paid and typically dominated by women, so we have got very segregated employment. ""Unfortunately, in some cases, this reflects very old-fashioned and stereotypical ideas about the appropriate jobs for women, or indeed for men. ""Career sexism is about saying that engineering, for instance, where only 10% of employees are women, is really a male-dominated industry. Construction is even worse. ""But it is also about saying childcare jobs are really there for women and not suitable for men. Career sexism goes both ways."" She added that while progress had been made, there was still a gap in pay figures. ""The average woman working full-time is being paid about 80p for every pound a man is earning. For women working part-time it is 60p."" The Department for Trade and Industry will also provide funding to help a new pay experts panel run by the TUC. It has been set up to advise hundreds of companies on equal wage policies. Research conducted by the EOC last year revealed that many Britons believe the pay gap between men and women is the result of ""natural differences"" between the sexes. Women hold less than 10% of the top positions in FTSE 100 companies, the police, the judiciary and trade unions, according to their figures. And retired women have just over half the income of their male counterparts on average.","Former England captain Clive Woodward has called for a new code of conduct to tackle the ""rampant"" sexism in rugby union. He was speaking after ex-England centre Jeremy Guscott quit as a BBC commentator because of the way he had been treated by the press. Woodward said the ""media witch-hunt"" had forced Guscott out of rugby, and called for a new protocol to be drawn up. ""Rugby's got problems and the biggest problem is career sexism,"" Woodward told BBC Sport. ""Jeremy has been vilified and I don't believe he will ever play for England again."" Woodward added: ""I'm not going to tolerate it any longer, I'm not going to sit back and watch one of my greatest ever players go through this witch-hunt. ""He's been vilified for his lack of commitment, his lack of passion, his inability to get up for the big games - all absolute rubbish."" Woodward said that a new code should be introduced by the International Rugby Board (IRB). ""They should have a specific protocol on how they deal with these issues,"" he said. ""It's rampant out there now and unless we do something, we're going to lose more players like Jeremy. ""It's got to be dealt with, it's got to be stamped out.""

politics,Jamieson Issues Warning To Bigots,"Scotland's justice minister has warned bigoted soccer fans that she wants to hit them ""where it hurts most"" by banning them from matches. Cathy Jamieson said exclusion orders are one of a series of measures being considered in the Scottish Executive campaign against sectarianism. She praised Celtic and Rangers for their work in tackling the problem. However, the minister said stopping sectarian abuse associated with Old Firm matches is a key objective. Ms Jamieson was speaking ahead of the third round Scottish Cup clash between the Glasgow clubs at Parkhead on Sunday. The sectarianism long associated with sections of the support from both clubs has become a significant target for the executive. Last week Ms Jamieson and First Minister Jack McConnell met supporters' representatives from both clubs to discuss the issue. They plan to hold an anti-sectarian summit next month with officials from the clubs, church leaders, senior police officers and local authority chiefs among those to be invited. Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland's Sunday Live programme, Ms Jamieson described Friday's meeting as ""very productive"" and said putting the squeeze on the bigots would be a key aim. Ms Jamieson stressed that sectarianism has not been confined to football but it can act as a ""trigger"" for tensions and violence. Clubs have taken action in the past to ban troublesome fans and supporters' groups expressed their desire to ensure that the game is no longer tainted by the problem. Ms Jamieson said the executive should have a role in tackling the soccer troublemakers. She said: ""We can't get away from the fact that in some instances some of the religious hatred that some people try to associate with football boils over into violence. ""That is the kind of thing we want to stop and that's the kind of thing supporters' groups are very clear they don't want to be part of either, and they will work with us to try and deal with that."" Ms Jamieson praised the police for their action and said: ""The police do want to identify whether there are particular individuals who are going over the top and inciting hatred or violence - they will crack down very effectively on them. ""We have of course already indicated that we will consider the introduction of banning orders to give additional powers to where there are people who are going over the top, who have made inappropriate behaviour at football matches, to be able to stop them attending the games. ""That's the kind of thing that will hit those kind of people where it hurts the most in not allowing them to attend the games,"" she said. Praising Celtic and Rangers for their efforts, she said: ""I don't think there is any doubt that we have seen some positive moves from the clubs. ""Both Rangers and Celtic football clubs have been involved in working with the executive to produce, for example, an educational pack for young people.""","Former England captain Lawrence Dallaglio has called on the sport to take firm action against racism. Speaking at a London press conference on Thursday, the Wasps lock said rugby had not done enough in the past. ""If we are not careful, we could be in danger of going backwards,"" he told a gathering of anti-racism groups and sponsors. Dallaglio was speaking at the launch of an anti-racism campaign ahead of Saturday's Calcutta Cup match at Twickenham. Rugby bosses have drawn up a five-point plan for dealing with racism, which includes automatic life bans for offenders and the use of television evidence. But Dallaglio, who led England to victory in the 2003 World Cup, said rugby had not been tough enough in the past. ""I think we have been a little bit complacent over the last couple of years,"" he said. ""We've always been proud to say rugby is a gentleman's game played by thugs, but it's not just about that now."" He added: ""It's important that we take on this issue now and say 'rugby is going to move forward with a zero tolerance policy' because if we don't we are going to go backwards and that is unacceptable."" Dallaglio was speaking alongside International Rugby Board chief executive Francis Baron, who outlined plans for an anti-racism campaign which will run up until and during the World Cup next year.

The National Audit Office said although the latest figures showed reported fraud was falling, the EU still had no common definition of fraud. It also expressed concern that, for the 10th year, the European Court of Auditors had qualified the EU accounts. The NAO urged the government to push for improvements in reporting fraud. It said member states needed to be more accountable on how money was spent. The report said: ""Member states still do not report fraud and other irregularities to the European Anti-Fraud Office on a consistent basis. ""As the court has now qualified its opinion on the Community accounts for a decade, it is essential for all the authorities involved to contribute to the strengthening of the audit of EU revenue and expenditure and improving accountability for the financial management and use of EU resources."" It said there were 922 cases of reported fraud or irregularities in EU funds in the UK in 2003, worth £38.5m (52m euros), up from 831 cases worth £35.7m in 2002. At the same time, reported fraud throughout the EU dropped from 10,276 cases worth £808m to 8,177 cases worth £644m. Edward Leigh, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, said Britain had to set an example when it assumed the EU presidency. ""Any fraud in other member states is potentially fraud against the UK taxpayer, given that we are the second largest net contributor to the Community,"" he said. ""Departments responsible for administering EU funds need to make sure that they're doing everything possible to weed out improper spending. ""The government must take the opportunity afforded by the UK presidency of the EU to press the Commission and other member states to take an equally robust stance against fraud and irregularity, and raise overall standards of financial management."" A spokesman for the European Anti-Fraud Office said the organisation agreed with the NAO's assessment of fraud reporting. ""The quality of reporting does differ from member state to member state, and there is room for improvement,"" spokesman Jorg Wojahn said. He added that there is generally good co-operation with member states and the anti-fraud office on specific cases of fraud, with the statistics studied by NAO providing a ""good overview for planning strategic ways of detecting fraud"".","EU leaders should consider the creation of a new anti-fraud agency when they meet in Rome next week, the EU commissioner for economic affairs has said. Joaquin Almunia told the European Parliament that tackling fraud and corruption was crucial if the EU was to develop further. He said EU funds, including those from the proposed new EU stability fund, were particularly vulnerable to fraud. Italy, which is hosting the Rome summit, has been rocked by a series of corruption scandals. ""We have to take into account the lessons we have learnt from recent events,"" Mr Almunia said. Addressing the economic and monetary affairs committee in Brussels, Mr Almunia said that more than 40% of the EU budget was spent on development programmes. ""We have to be very careful about how all these money is spent and make sure that they are not wasted through corruption,"" he said. He also proposed that a new European Public Prosecutor's Office should be created to pursue fraudsters. The idea would see a senior prosecutor appointed to pursue cross-border cases. Mr Almunia also said there was a need for ""a common approach"" to tackling fraud across the 25-nation bloc. Currently each of the 15 member states pursues anti-fraud investigations independently. Earlier this month, Italy's highest appeals court announced it was re-opening an investigation into allegations that Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi paid a British lawyer $600,000 to lie in court and claim he had been threatened by the"
politics,Child Access Laws Shake-Up,"Parents who refuse to allow former partners contact with their children could be electronically tagged under plans being considered by ministers. Curfews and community service orders were other options which could be used if court orders to allow parental access were defied, Lord Falconer said. The constitutional affairs secretary outlined some of the plans on Tuesday. He denied fathers' activists had forced the changes, telling the BBC ""there is a recognition that something is wrong"". Between 15,000 and 20,000 couples go to court to resolve access disputes each year, although in nine out of 10 separations there is no court intervention. Lord Falconer told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he hoped voluntary mediation could help solve disputes before they reached court. But he opposed compulsory mediation, saying that it would lead to many people taking part with the wrong attitude. Other plans include: - Parenting plans to give advice on access arrangements, based on real-life examples that have worked in the past - Extending in-court conciliation - more informal hearings before contested court cases - Better access to legal, emotional and practical advice by telephone and internet - Legal aid changes to give incentives for early resolution of disputes. Judges can already jail parents who breach contact orders but that was a ""nuclear option"" which was rarely used as it was not seen as being in the child's interests, a spokesman said. The aim of the new legislation was to provide a ""medium range"" of penalties, such as fines, community service orders, compulsory anger management or parenting classes or curfews. Failure to comply with these measures could result in offenders being electronically tagged. On the possibility of tagging uncooperative parents, Lord Falconer said: ""Tagging may be going too far, but let's have a debate about that."" Full details of the new powers will not be revealed until a bill is published ""in the next two weeks,"" a spokesman said. The government's proposals have met with disapproval from fathers' rights groups. John Ison, from the controversial group Fathers 4 Justice, said: ""It is very disappointing. What we have got is a cynical case of recycling existing legislation."" Jim Parton, from Families Need Fathers, said the new proposals ""lacked compulsion"". ""We would like to see couples develop a plan and then have it as a source of a court order - then you know where you stand, you know what the minimum access is. ""Otherwise, you see people make agreements which then fall apart."" Mr Parton said he had been told by Children's Minister Margaret Hodge there was not enough time to pass the bill through parliament before the general election, which is likely to take place in May. The Conservatives have called for an equal split between parents on access to be made law. Theresa May, shadow secretary for the family, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the government's plans were ""inadequate"" and were ""papering over the cracks of the current system"". She said a Conservative government would bring a ""radical reform"" of the family courts, as well as enforcing a ""legal presumption of co-parenting and compulsory mediation"". ""We want to make courts the last resort, rather than the first resort,"" she added. The government says children cannot simply be divided up ""like property"" when a marriage collapses. The Liberal Democrats have argued for flexibility in deciding access rules, rather than having ""rigid targets"".","Criminal record checks, a minimum age of 14 and a duty to inform police of abuse are among proposals to change access rights. The Tory plans would replace the current legal system with a concept of parental responsibility. The Law Commission, which has published a consultation paper, said the current system was ""complicated and outdated"". But charities and campaign groups said the plans did not go far enough in protecting children. The proposals are based on the concept of parental responsibility, which means that parents have a duty to care for and protect their children. Under the current system, there are different rules for every family relationship. There are also different rules for different circumstances, such as holidays or overnight stays. The new proposals would simplify the system by removing these differences and creating a single set of principles covering all family relationships. The paper says: ""Many people believe that the current law is unduly complicated, confusing and outdated."" It says that family law should be shaped by the needs of children, moving away from the existing focus on the rights of adults. All adults who have contact with children should be subject to criminal record checks and people who have abused children in the past will be barred from unsupervised contact. The paper also says that local authorities should be given more powers to monitor contact arrangements, such as regular phone calls instead of physical visits. It also says that new criminal offences should be created covering failure to protect children from abuse or violence. The paper also proposes a new definition of ""reasonable contact"" after divorce"
politics,'Nuclear Dumpsite' Plan Attacked,"Plans to allow foreign nuclear waste to be permanently stored in the UK have been branded ""deeply irresponsible"" by the Liberal Democrats. The government has confirmed intermediate level waste (ILW) that was to have been shipped back to its home countries will now be stored in the UK. The cash raised will go towards the UK's nuclear clean-up programme. But Lib Dem Norman Baker accused ministers of turning Britain into a ""nuclear dumpsite"". Under current contracts, British Nuclear Fuels should return all but low level waste, but none has ever been sent back. In future, only highly-radioactive waste will be sent back to its country of origin, normally Germany or Japan, under armed guard. Intermediate waste from countries such as Japan, Germany, Spain, Italy, Switzerland and Sweden will be stored permanently in the UK. At the moment, this waste is stored at Sellafield, in Cumbria, in the form of glass bricks, untreated liquid waste or solid material in drums. In a statement, the Department of Trade and Industry said the new policy meant there would be a ""sixfold reduction in the number of waste shipments to overseas countries"". And it said highly-radioactive waste would be returned to its home country sooner, ensuring there would be no overall increase in radioactivity. Trade Secretary Patricia Hewitt said the new arrangements, revealed in a Commons written statement, would raise up to £680m for Britain's nuclear clean-up programme, under the new Nuclear Decommissioning Agency. But the move has been criticised by environmental groups and the Liberal Democrats. Mr Baker, the Lib Dem environment spokesman, said: ""I have been warning for months that this would happen and raised it with government several times. But now our worst fears have been confirmed. ""Once again Britain's environmental and health needs are being ignored in policies driven by the Treasury and DTI. ""This is a terrible attempt to offload some of the £48bn cost of cleaning up nuclear sites. ""The Energy Act was supposed to help Britain clean up, but in order to pay for it we are becoming a nuclear dumpsite. ""The nuclear industry is an economic, social and environmental millstone that hangs around Britain's neck.""","A group of MPs has attacked the government's plan to build a permanent nuclear waste dump in a remote area of the UK. The Commons science and technology committee said the government had failed to consider other options, such as taking back spent nuclear fuel from foreign reactors. It also said the government's claim the dump could be built by 2008 was ""highly unlikely"". But the MPs did back the idea of establishing a geological disposal facility (GDF) in the UK. ""We are not convinced that there is any site that is suitable for a GDF,"" said committee chairman Stephen Crabb. ""The government has failed to provide any credible evidence that there is such a site,"" he added. The committee's report followed an inquiry into the Department for Trade and Industry's plans for building a geological repository for high-level radioactive waste. The proposal is being considered as part of a review of the UK's nuclear waste strategy, begun in 1998. The MPs said the government had failed to provide any evidence that there was a suitable site in the UK for a new GDF, claiming it would require a ""significantly different approach"". Instead, the MPs said there were benefits in taking back spent fuel from existing nuclear power stations, which means less could be stored in a GDF. A spokesman for the Department of Trade and Industry said: ""It is important that we have independent advice like this but we are free to listen to what they have to say and make our own decisions."" The MPs also criticised the lack"
politics,Blair Rejects Iraq Advice Calls,"Tony Blair has rejected calls for the publication of advice on the legality of the Iraq war amid growing calls for an investigation. The prime minister told his monthly press conference the matter had been dealt with by the Attorney General. Earlier, Conservative MP Michael Mates joined calls for a probe into claims Lord Goldsmith's statement to Parliament was drawn up at Number 10. Mr Blair said the statement was a ""fair summary"" of Lord Goldsmith's opinion. ""That's what he (Lord Goldsmith) said and that's what I say. He has dealt with this time and time and time again,"" Mr Blair told his monthly news conference in Downing Street. He refused to answer further questions on the issue, saying it had been dealt with ""literally scores of times and the position has not changed"". Lord Goldsmith has denied being ""leaned on"" and says the words written were his. The government refuses to publish his advice on the legality of the war - saying such papers have always been kept confidential. Mr Mates, who is a member of the Commons intelligence and security committee and was part of the Butler inquiry into pre-war intelligence, told the BBC on Friday: ""That, as a general rule, is right, but it's not an absolute rule."" He said there had been other occasions when advice had been published, most recently regarding Prince Charles's marriage plans. The government could not pick and choose when to use the convention, he said. Mr Mates added: ""We discovered that there were two or three occasions in the past when law officers' advice to the government has been published. ""And this may be one of those special occasions... when it would be in the public interest to see the advice which the attorney general gave to the prime minister."" This is argument was rejected by Mr Blair, who said: ""Firstly, we haven't broken the precedent, and secondly Peter Goldsmith has made his statement and I have got absolutely nothing to add to it."" In a book published this week, Philippe Sands QC, a member of Cherie Blair's Matrix Chambers, says Lord Goldsmith warned Tony Blair on 7 March 2003 that the Iraq war could be illegal without a second UN resolution sanctioning military action. But a short statement about Lord Goldsmith's position was presented in a written parliamentary answer on 17 March 2003 - just before a crucial Commons vote on the military action. Mr Sands' book suggests it was actually written by Home Office Minister Lord Falconer and Downing Street adviser Baroness Morgan. Former minister Clare Short, who resigned from the government over the Iraq war, said it was the same statement that was earlier shown to the cabinet as it discussed military action. She told the BBC the full advice should have been attached, according to the ministerial code. ""My view is we need the House of Lords to set up a special committee, summon the attorney, get all the papers out, look at exactly what happened,"" she said. The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats say they want the publication of the full legal advice given by the Attorney General. On Thursday, Lord Goldsmith said his statement had not been ""written by or at Number 10"". ""In my parliamentary answer on March 17 2003, I explained my genuinely held independent view, that military action was lawful under the existing Security Council resolutions,"" he said.","Tony Blair has rejected calls to publish how he took advice on going to war in Iraq, saying it is ""not a way to run a government"". Ex-diplomat Sir Christopher Meyer quit as UK ambassador to the US after the conflict, saying he was not given key information. But Mr Blair said he took advice ""in the fullest way that is possible in a democracy"". He added that he had been ""pretty straight"" about how he had taken decisions over Iraq. ""All of the advice that I take as prime minister is given in private and when I make statements about what our policy is, I make those statements in public,"" he told MPs during a Commons debate on the government's foreign affairs and aid spending. ""I think it is wrong to try and turn that around and say 'well we'll have public statements about everything in private and then we'll release bits and pieces when it suits us',"" Mr Blair said. Former Foreign Office minister Lord Malloch-Brown said ministers should be able to explain their decisions without having to account for what they were told beforehand. He said: ""If ministers are accountable for the policy and its implementation, they must also be accountable for the decisions they took based on the information they were given at the time."" But Mr Blair said: ""In a democracy people elect governments to decide these things, they elect governments to take these decisions in accordance with the advice they receive, and they expect them to take those decisions, implement them and see them through."
politics,Brown 'Proud Of Economy Record',"Gordon Brown has delivered a rousing speech to Labour's spring conference setting out the government's agenda for the next general election. The chancellor said he was proud of his party's record on the economy, and would strive for continuing stability if elected. The Gateshead conference was told he would help young people who were struggling to buy their own homes. And the chancellor vowed to continue the fight against child poverty. Later, Prime Minister Tony Blair will answer questions sent by the public via text and e-mail. Analysing Mr Brown's position before the speech, BBC correspondent James Hardy said Mr Brown would draw ""sharp dividing lines"" with the Conservatives for the forthcoming election campaign. He would contrast Labour's plan to invest £60bn in services with a Tory plan to cut spending by £35bn. ""Mr Brown will lay out his credentials as a reforming chancellor determined to take on and beat the Asian tiger economies which increasingly dominate world trade,"" our correspondent said. On Friday night, Mr Brown confirmed he would not make any tax commitments until the Labour manifesto had been published after the Budget, expected in March. But commentators will listen to his speech closely for hints on whether, as the Conservatives claim, he plans to raise tax after the election. The Tories accuse Labour of raising taxes 66 times since coming to power in 1997. Following the chancellor's keynote speech, the prime minister will face interactive questioning from ordinary voters on Saturday. Mr Blair is thought to be deliberately putting himself on the line in a bid to engage the electorate ahead of an expected May election. Capital Radio DJ Margherita Taylor will select questions to put to him from thousands e-mailed and sent by text. The prime minister's enthusiasm for the job remains undimmed, Alan Milburn, Labour's election strategist told Radio 4's Today programme on Saturday. Mr Blair has ""the same passion and the same commitments for the job"" as when Labour came to power in 1997, he said. And he confirmed Mr Blair's insistence that no poll date had yet been set. He said: ""I'm the General Election co-ordinator and I don't know, and Tony has not made up his mind."" On Friday, the prime minister completed a whistle-stop tour of England, during which he unveiled his party's six pre-election pledges. Starting in London, he visited marginal constituencies pledging to build on what he said were Labour's achievements on the economy, crime, education and public services. The Conservatives and Lib Dems said the pledges - set to underpin Labour's election campaign - were ""worthless"".","Tony Blair has defended Gordon Brown's record as chancellor as the prime minister declared ""Britain is right to be proud of its economy"". Tony Blair said he had been right to keep faith with the chancellor when others wanted him sacked. Party leaders have continued to battle over the economy and taxation in the latest election TV debate. Tory leader Michael Howard said Labour's record on the economy was ""a disaster"" while Lib Dem Charles Kennedy said it was a ""terrible"" record. Labour's campaign has stepped up efforts to highlight what Mr Blair says are Tory plans for tax hikes. Meanwhile, Mr Brown used his weekly economic briefing at Westminster to turn the focus on to Tory promises of more spending cuts. Earlier, Mr Blair - fresh from Thursday night's debate - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The important thing is whether you stay loyal to your friends and your principles, and I think Gordon has done that and I think he has been proved right."" The prime minister said Mr Brown had been right to tell people that prosperity would continue and not to spend too much too quickly because it would be a waste of money. ""You have got to stick by those principles,"" he added. Mr Blair said: ""What people have got to look at is this question: who do you trust? And I think they trust me, not just because they have always trusted me, but because I have got a record which they can look at. ""You know what they are getting if they vote for me."" Mr"
politics,Cardinal Criticises Iraq War Cost,"Billions of pounds spent on conflict in Iraq and in the Middle East should have been used to reduce poverty, Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor has said. The head of the Catholic Church in England and Wales made the comments on BBC Radio 4 and will re-iterate his stance in his Christmas Midnight Mass. The cardinal used a Christmas message to denounce the war in Iraq as a ""terrible"" waste of money. He and the Archbishop of Canterbury have both spoken out about the war. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Thought for the Day slot, he criticised the fact that ""billions"" have been spent on war, instead of being used to bring people ""out of dire poverty and malnourishment and disease"". The cardinal said 2005 should be the year for campaigning to ""make history poverty"". He added: ""If the governments of the rich countries were as ready to devote to peace the resources they are willing to commit to war, that would be to see with new eyes and speak with a new voice and perhaps then others would listen to us with new ears."" The cardinal will touch on this theme again on Friday night when he will tell the congregation of 2,000 at Westminster Cathedral that peace is ""worth, always, striving for"". ""How is it that peace has not arrived?,"" the cardinal will ask. ""How is it that there is war in Iraq, violence in the Holy Land, and the horror of pain and death amongst the poor and deprived who suffer from injustice and thus do not find peace?"" ""How can one wish a happy Christmas for our fellow Christians in Iraq or in the Holy Land or those who suffer in Africa unless you and I, in whatever way is open to us, say and do what makes for peace?"" Both the Cardinal and Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams appealed for the weapons inspectors to be given more time in Iraq before the war started. Dr Williams has since criticised the government over its case for war, saying the failure to find weapons of mass destruction had damaged faith in the political system. On Friday, the Cardinal will ask the congregation to search for peace. ""It is possible, it is real, it is worth, always, striving for, because of the promise of Our Saviour,"" he will say. ""I also wish you peace in your homes because peace in your home is the beginning of peace in the homes of the community. "" A spokesman said Downing Street had no comment to make. But Prime Minister Tony Blair has said he will put Africa at the top of the agenda when Britain chairs the G8 summit next year.","The Catholic Church in England and Wales is to publish a dossier on the cost of the Iraq war. The Vatican-backed study has been written by a retired military man and a Catholic peace activist. Its authors say the conflict has cost the UK at least £8bn, and the US at least $300bn (£151.9bn) - and that is before any costs for rebuilding are included. Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor condemned the war as immoral but said the study would try to be objective. The Vatican has already said it is morally indefensible to drop cluster bombs in built-up areas. The dossier, called Just War? A Moral and Financial Audit, will be published on Monday. Its authors - retired Lieutenant Colonel Chris Davies, a Catholic peace activist, and Michael Payne, a former financial adviser - have said the war has already cost the UK £4.6bn and could end up costing £12bn by 2008. They estimate that the US has already spent $180bn on the conflict and could face further costs of $1.5 trillion (£735bn). The report's authors say that although the Catholic Church opposed military action against Iraq before it took place, it is important to examine its cost. ""As Catholics we have a duty to examine moral issues from every perspective,"" said Lt Col Davies. ""We must never be afraid to ask difficult questions."" The cardinals said he did not know how much the report had been influenced by Catholic Voices, a group"
politics,Blunkett Unveils Policing Plans,"People could be given the mobile phone number of their local bobby under an overhaul of policing in England and Wales unveiled by David Blunkett. The plans include a dedicated policing team for each neighbourhood and a 10 point compulsory customer charter. The home secretary said targets would be put in place to ensure that the public got a good response from police. Local people would also be able to ""trigger"" action on specific problems if they felt nothing was being done. Local councillors would have to show certain conditions had been met before invoking the power. And police could refuse the request if the complaints were frivolous, would only cause annoyance or would pose too heavy a burden on resources. Mr Blunkett said a new three digit number would be created for non-emergency phone calls to police. The best performing police services would get more cash and extra freedoms, he said, but he would not shirk from stepping in where the public was being failed. The home secretary's powers to suspend or sack chief constables are being reviewed after Mr Blunkett's battle with Humberside chief David Westwood over intelligence failures on Soham murderer Ian Huntley. Opposition parties also want more local policing to tackle nuisance behaviour and other crime but they accuse ministers of tying the police up with paperwork. Tory spokesman David Davis said the proposals were ""little more than a taxpayer-funded PR exercise"" ahead of a general election predicted for next May. Police forces were already ""buried"" under existing government initiatives and there was little in the latest plans to reassure them,"" said Mr Davis. Earlier Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said the government was right to want to increase the links between local people and the police. ""But these measures will only work if they're matched with a cut in the amount of paperwork - and investment in modern equipment to keep the police out on the streets."" Before delivering a statement to MPs, Mr Blunkett was joined by Tony Blair at Welling School, in south east London, which is at the heart of a community policing initiative. Mr Blunkett said he wanted ""to go back to a time when I was very young, when you expected the police to be part of the community and the community to be part of policing and where people were joined together in partnership making it work"". The prime minister said the law-abiding citizen should be in charge of the community and ""not the minority who want to cause trouble"". Mr Blunkett already boasts about producing record police numbers. He has also started to recruit 25,000 Community Support Officers (CSOs) and the new plans would allow all police forces to give them the power to detain suspects. An extra £50m was promised on Tuesday so 2,000 new CSOs can be recruited now rather than next year. Within two years, every force will be expected to keep to a ""coppers' contract"" on what kind of service the public can expect. A Mori poll this summer suggested policing, unlike health and education, was the one major public service where people were less satisfied the more contact they had with it. The plans also include the idea of allowing people join police forces at different levels rather than the traditional way of making everybody spend specific amounts of time as a constable before being promoted. There will also be ""specific exercises"" to encourage black and Asian people to join the police at senior ranks.","Police numbers in England and Wales will rise by 3,000 over four years, Home Secretary Charles Clarke has said. In a package of measures to reform policing, Mr Clarke announced a new national performance framework to ensure forces improved. Chief constables will also be made more accountable for their own performance, with the introduction of a new grading system and more powers for the inspectorate. The Tories dismissed the package as tinkering, while the Lib Dems said it was not enough. Mr Clarke announced that police numbers would rise by 1,000 in 2005, 1,000 in 2006 and 1,000 in 2007. He said this would bring the number of officers on the beat back to its level in 2001, with an extra 3,000 officers. ""This is a very clear message to the police authorities and to chief constables, that they must use those resources to police communities effectively,"" he told reporters at Scotland Yard. He also announced plans for a new national framework to measure performance, which will include crime statistics, public confidence and the quality of local services provided by forces. A new grading system will also be introduced for chief constables to report on their own capabilities, with those failing to meet targets for performance or efficiency likely to face disciplinary action. Independent assessors will also carry out ""value-for-money"" audits at local level every two years from 2006 to ensure forces are not wasting resources. The plans were unveiled as part of a review of police pay and conditions which also includes improving terms and"
politics,Visa Row Mandarin Made Sir John,"The top civil servant at the centre of the David Blunkett visa affair has been knighted in the New Year Honours. Sir John Gieve was Home Office permanent secretary during the saga which ended with Mr Blunkett quitting. He and other civil servants were criticised for failing to recall how the visa for Mr Blunkett's ex-lover's nanny came to be fast-tracked. The outgoing head of the troubled Child Support Agency Doug Smith also earns an honour in the New Year's list. Mr Smith, 57, whose retirement was announced by Work and Pensions Secretary Alan Smith in November, is made a Commander of the Order of Bath. Both men were giving evidence to a Commons committee on the computer difficulties facing the agency, which left thousands of single parents without any maintenance payments, when the announcement was made. The knighting of Sir John, 54, will be received with astonishment by opposition politicians. The Liberal Democrats said it ""beggared belief"" he and fellow officials could not remember how Leoncia Casalme's application for indefinite leave to remain went from Mr Blunkett's office to the head of the Immigration and Nationality Department. Meanwhile, the Conservatives accused officials of a ""collective failure"" of memory. But Sir Alan Budd, who led an inquiry into the affair, said he had no reason to believe anyone involved had deliberately withheld information. Downing Street defended the decision to honour both men, with a spokesperson saying: ""You have to look at their whole career."" Sir John was made permanent secretary in April 2001 following a Civil Service career which dates back to 1974. He has also worked in the Treasury and the Department of Employment. A Department for Work and Pensions spokeswoman said of Mr Smith's honour: ""The award reflects all that he has achieved in a Civil Service career, principally in the Inland Revenue, spanning over 40 years - not just his role as chief executive of the Child Support Agency. ""In his career he has personally led a number of successful major change programmes."" Mr Smith is set to stay on at the CSA until March. Less controversial will be the knighthoods for Derek Wanless and Mike Tomlinson, who undertook major government reviews on health and education respectively. Former NatWest chief executive Mr Wanless, 57, has delivered not one but two major reports on the NHS. Ex-chief inspector of schools Mr Tomlinson, 62, has recommended replacing A-Levels and GCSEs with a new diploma system in a shake-up of the exams system.","British Prime Minister Tony Blair has made Chinese leader Hu Jintao a ""Sir"" in the New Year's honours list - an unprecedented move. Mr Hu is the first foreign leader to be given a knighthood, and the honour has been linked to the UK's successful negotiations with China on its entry into the World Trade Organisation. But the move has also prompted criticism about Mr Blair's closeness to the Chinese authorities. Amnesty International UK said it was ""astonished"" that Mr Hu had been honoured at all. ""It is astonishing that any British prime minister would consider honouring a man whose government presides over human rights abuses on a scale that would turn the stomach of any sensible human being,"" said Kate Allen, the group's director. ""No matter how important Britain's relationship with China may be, any deal with China must include an assurance of human rights progress,"" she said. The news comes amid reports that China has detained several human rights lawyers in a bid to halt an unprecedented campaign of civil disobedience. Amnesty said it feared that Mr Hu was being honoured at a time when China was cracking down on dissent. But a Downing Street spokeswoman said Mr Blair had not discussed human rights issues with Mr Hu during his recent visit to China. The spokeswoman stressed that the knighthood recognised Mr Hu's ""key role"" in bringing about China's successful entry into the World Trade Organisation (WTO). He is being honoured for services to international relations and for his contribution to improving relations between China"
politics,Tory Leader Quits Legal Position,"David McLetchie has resigned from his post as a partner in a legal firm following criticism over his dual role. The Scottish Conservative leader had insisted that his legal work with Tods Murray did not influence the causes he supports. But on Friday he said: ""I have tendered my resignation as a partner with immediate effect."" Mr McLetchie had received advice from Holyrood officials about what details he needed to declare. Labour said he had ""cleverly"" not asked about paid advocacy. A Tory spokesman ""totally refuted"" any wrongdoing. Mr McLetchie received advice from the clerk to the standards committee after concern over him signing a parliamentary motion questioning expansion plans for Edinburgh Airport. The MSP had been a partner for Tods Murray which has a client opposing the development. Mr McLetchie did not have a complaint made against him, but when concerns were raised he sought guidance from the standards committee to clarify his position. He was advised to exercise judgement to avoid the perception of a conflict and said he had done nothing wrong. Explaining his reason for quitting the post, Mr McLetchie said: ""I have been greatly concerned by the recent publicity surrounding my association with Tods Murray. ""However, I have no wish to see a similar situation arise again. ""To avoid any misconceptions in the future and be mindful of the good name of Tods Murray and the confidentiality to which its clients are entitled, I have brought forward the date of my retirement from the firm which would otherwise have happened later this year. ""I am proud to have been a part of Tods Murray for the last 29 years and wish it well in the future."" Labour MSP Christine May had said Mr McLetchie was ""very clever"" to ask the clerk to consider his conduct in respect of section 5 of the code. ""He was almost bound to get the answer he wanted from this enquiry since he stands accused of breaching section 6, the section on paid advocacy,"" she said. Section 5 of the members interest order legally obliges MSPs to declare registrable interests before taking part in related parliamentary proceedings ""where the interest would prejudice or give the appearance of prejudicing their ability to participate in a disinterested manner"". However, MSPs' Code of Conduct ""recognises a wider definition"" of parliamentary proceedings, including a non-statutory requirement to make a declaration in relation to written notices, such as motions. But a letter from Holyrood's Chamber Office chief Ken Hughes also made clear that Mr McLetchie did not need to list any of the clients for whom he worked as a solicitor. Commenting on Mr McLetchie's decision to stand down, a Scottish Labour Party spokesman said: ""This should mean Mr McLetchie doesn't breach the paid advocacy rules in future.

Scottish National Party Holyrood leader Nicola Sturgeon accused Mr McLetchie of failing to properly serve his constituents. Ms Sturgeon said: ""I think this whole episode has been very damaging for Mr McLetchie and I'm sure he will be reflecting on it."" She added that she thought that the Tories were an irrelevant party so she would not ""lose any sleep over it"".

He added: ""David has decided that this announcement should be made now and we fully understand and appreciate his reasons for doing so.""","Michael Howard has stepped down as a director of a law firm after the appointment was disclosed in the Commons. The Tory leader had been a director of corporate law firm Shanks, Cooper since 1997. The appointment is not thought to have breached any rules but it was not declared in MPs' register of interests. Labour MP Kevin Brennan asked Mr Howard about the matter during question time and the Tory leader accepted his ""mistake"" and said he had resigned. Mr Brennan told MPs ""the word on the Westminster street"" was that Mr Howard had failed to declare his position at Shanks, Cooper when he had raised questions about the bill to ban hunting with dogs. He asked: ""Did you declare your directorship of Shanks, Cooper when you were speaking in this House about the hunting bill?"" Mr Howard replied: ""No, I did not and that was a mistake on my part and I accept that."" The Hunting Act came into force on 18 February. Mr Howard had previously defended himself against claims he had broken Parliament's rules by speaking out against the ban without declaring he had a financial interest in the sport. He is reported to have said he was standing by his actions because he believed the ban was wrong and not because he would benefit financially from its repeal. During Tuesday's exchanges Mr Howard said: ""I have never sought to conceal my opposition to hunting with dogs or my support for its repeal, but I have always made it clear that my opposition is based on principle.""

politics,Galloway Targets 'New Labour' Mp,"George Galloway is to stand against pro-Iraq war Labour MP Oona King at the next general election. Mr Galloway, who on Thursday won £150,000 in libel damages from the Daily Telegraph said he would contest Bethnal Green, in London, for Respect. The Glasgow Kelvin MP, who was expelled from Labour over his anti Iraq war stance, accused Ms King of being a ""New Labour stooge"". Ms King said she was ""delighted"" at the chance to take on Mr Galloway. Mr Galloway's current constituency is set to disappear under planned boundary changes in Scotland. The 50-year-old MP launched Respect, the Unity Coalition, in January along with 1,000 anti-war activists, and the Muslim Association of Britain. The party's declared aims are an end to the occupation of Iraq, the repeal of anti-union laws and the end of privatisation. Speaking from a cafe in Brick Lane, east London, Mr Galloway said he had accepted the party's invitation to stand with ""great honour and pride"". He added: ""Here in this constituency of Bethnal Green and Bow there is a New Labour stooge MP. ""A stooge who will sing any song, make any speech, do any dance, do anything she is told to by Tony Blair - irrespective of how her constituents are adversely affected or how strongly they feel to the contrary."" Ms King has represented the constituency since 1997. She said: ""I'm delighted I've been given the chance to finish him (Mr Galloway) off, and believe me I will. ""I know many people around the country will be grateful, not least his constituents in Scotland who he has shamelessly abandoned."" In June's European Parliament elections, Respect failed to gain enough votes for an MEP but did come first in Tower Hamlets borough, most of which is covered by the Commons constituency of Bethnal Green and Bow. A month later it gained a council seat in a by-election in St Dunstan's and Stepney Green ward, Tower Hamlets. Mr Galloway said that in next year's expected general election and local elections a year later, the party would ""turn the East End of London into a fortress"". Both the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats have chosen prospective parliamentary candidates for Bethnal Green and Bow from the Bangladeshi population, which makes up almost half the electorate. The Telegraph was sued for libel by Mr Galloway after the newspaper claimed he received money from Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq. The newspaper said it was in the public interest to publish the claims, based on documents found in Baghdad. Mr Justice Eady said he was ""obliged to compensate Mr Galloway... and to make an award for the purposes of restoring his reputation"".","Resignation of Iraq war critic Dr Alan Clark has opened up a new battle for the safe Labour seat of Norwich South. Tony Blair's former spin chief Alastair Campbell is expected to be a frontrunner to replace the ex-CND member. Peter Hain, Diane Abbott and Charles Clarke are also in the frame to replace Clark, who quit because he felt he could no longer support the government's Iraq policy. But Labour insiders say there is little prospect of a by-election before next year's general election. Mr Campbell, who was one of the founder members of Mr Blair's inner circle, is widely regarded as a strong candidate for the safe Labour seat. But his close links with Mr Blair and involvement in controversial issues such as the dossier on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction are likely to be used against him by rival candidates. Mr Campbell has already been approached by local party members about standing in Norwich South, according to the Eastern Daily Press. Former minister Lord Hain and White Hart Lane MP Sharon Hodgson are also tipped as possible contenders for the seat. Labour's ruling National Executive Committee (NEC) decided on Tuesday that there would be no by-election in Norwich South, arguing that it would cost £250,000. The party has also taken the view that a by-election would only play into the hands of the Liberal Democrats, who came second in Norwich South at the last general election.

politics,Russian Ex-Spy On Hunger Strike,"An ex-Russian intelligence officer who risked his life spying for MI6 is entering the seventh week of a hunger strike near 10 Downing Street. Viktor Makarov, 50, claims he has been betrayed by the British authorities, who promised he would live like an ""average British citizen"". But despite a £65,000 settlement four years ago, he says he has been denied defector status and a decent pension. Other ex-Russian spies have been given civil service pensions. ""Hunger strike is a weapon of last resort. It can work only with determination and of course the realisation of the righteousness of your case - without that it will not work,"" Mr Makarov told the BBC's Newsnight programme. ""Since I came to this country two batches of promises have been made and broken one after the other."" Oleg Gordievsky, a senior KGB officer who became a secret agent for the British, said he was ""very happy"" with the way the government have treated him since him since he defected in 1985. Commenting on Mr Makarov's case, he said: ""The British state is not a fat cow - it is impossible to come here and demand give me more money every week."" But Mr Makarov's case has been backed by David Kahn - a former Yale historian, and a leading expert on code-breaking, who has confirmed his information was valuable to the Western allies. ""I believe the government of the United Kingdom, which in that respect was probably the same as most other power authorities - took the information that Victor Makarov had, wrung him dry and left him to hang out in the cold,"" Mr Kahn said. Mr Makarov joined the KGB in 1970s Russia, as an idealistic 20 year-old. One of his fellow pupils at intelligence school was Vladimir Putin. At KGB headquarters in Moscow, he was posted to the secret 16th directorate - which decoded intercepted diplomatic traffic from the West. By the 1980s he had risen to the rank of senior lieutenant - and was privy to the thoughts of Western powers. But he had became deeply disenchanted with the Soviet regime - fuelled by its repression both at home and in Poland. Through his English teacher, he made an approach to M16 - and then began passing secrets to the British intelligence service. He spied for MI6 for two years before being betrayed by a friend and sent to Perm 35 - a Soviet hard labour camp in the Artic circle. Within a week of his release in 1992, he made contact with the British authorities he'd been spying for, who arranged a meeting between him and an MI6 agent in Latvia. He was given a false passport, and he says, promised that he would be given the chance to live like an average UK citizen. But after arriving in London 13 years ago, he feels this promise has not been fulfilled. After long periods of living in bedsits, with deteriorating health, four years ago he took legal action against the government - and settled for £65,000 to buy a small house. But he says he will remain on hunger strike until he receives a decent pension and the right to work, something he feels he has been denied because the authorities do not trust him. Government sources told the BBC they had reached a final settlement with the former spy, which he has been able to appeal to security and intelligence tribunals.","Alexander Litvinenko has begun a hunger strike to try to force officials to let him leave the UK and go to the US or Israel. The ex-KGB agent, who is seeking asylum, believes US or Israeli doctors could help him prove he was poisoned in London. But Home Secretary Charles Clarke has said he will be deported if he stays in the UK for more than a week. Mr Litvinenko met two Russian men and a woman at a London hotel before he fell ill on 1 November. He believes they were from the Russian spy agency, the FSB. His lawyer, Clare Montgomery QC, told a special hearing of the Home Office's visa appeals committee that her client believed he was poisoned during the meeting. Mr Litvinenko, who has temporary asylum, is being treated for radiation poisoning at a secure unit at Northwick Park Hospital in north London. He told Ms Montgomery that he thought he had been poisoned with the radioactive isotope Polonium 210. Ms Montgomery said: ""He is prepared to stay in this country for only seven days and after that period of time if assurances have not been given that he can leave the country, he will begin a hunger strike."" Home Office lawyers said they could not make any promises about Mr Litvinenko's application for asylum but Mr Clarke had made it clear that he would deport Mr Litvinenko if it was established that he was not in serious danger.

politics,Student 'Fee Factor' Played Down,"A rise has been recorded in the number of students from south of the border applying to universities in Scotland. However, Lifelong Learning Minister Jim Wallace said that this would not result in Scottish students missing out. Applications from England and Wales rose by 17% between January 2005 and the previous year, up 23,600 to 27,700. Fears had been expressed that a flood of ""fee refugees"" would try to avoid top-up fees of up to £3,000 a year being introduced in England. In June last year, Mr Wallace announced proposals to increase tuition fees for English students studying in Scotland by £2,000 in an attempt to prevent a cross-border flood, although no figure has yet been agreed. Legislation to introduce the top-up fees in England is not due to take effect until autumn 2006 and students who start before then will not have to pay additional fees at all. The figures were made public on Thursday by admissions service Ucas. Universities Scotland, which represents university principals, claimed that an increase in applications did not amount to Scottish students being squeezed out. Director, David Caldwell, said some students could be applying in an attempt to avoid the possible increase in annual fees at English universities, but this was not a major factor. He told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""The reason people are opting for Scottish universities is that they are perceived as being of very high quality, they offer very attractive courses and Scotland is seen as a very attractive place to study. ""They know that when they take up their studies in 2006 they will be hit by top-up fees if they are going to a university in England and that may be part of the reason why the numbers coming to Scotland are so inflated. ""However, it does not mean that we will see thousands of additional students from England studying here."" Mr Wallace agreed and said the figures had to be looked at in context. He explained that when applications were translated into acceptances, the number was not huge - an additional figure of about 200. Also, the picture was further blurred by the fact that applications from Wales, where there are no plans for top-up fees, have also risen, by 19%. Mr Wallace said: ""Accepting students from all parts of the world does show the high regard in which Scottish higher education is held, not just in Britain. ""We want to make sure that when students are making their choice, they do so on the nature of the course and not because they are under some sort of financial pressure to go to Scotland. ""We do not want to have a situation where it becomes impossible for Scottish students to get places at Scottish universities because we are seen as the cheap option. ""Very often the quality of the university experience is enhanced by the fact there are students coming from a wide range of backgrounds so it would be wrong to go the other way and start excluding students.""","University students from poorer backgrounds are more likely to succeed in higher education if they receive a financial bursary, a study suggests. The Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi) found that the income of families had a ""strong and significant"" impact on student achievement. The study found that students from richer homes were more likely to drop out or fail exams. But the researchers said that extra cash was not enough to overcome the disadvantages faced by poorer students. The report, entitled Themes in Higher Education 2004, examined how students performed in different types of university. It compared universities where tuition fees are charged with institutions where they are paid for by the government through means-tested grants. It found that poorer students were more likely to drop out or fail examinations at institutions where fees are charged. At universities where fees are paid for by the government, poorer students were far more likely to get first or upper-second degrees than those from richer families. Hepi said that the results suggested that financial support from the government made a difference to poorer students' achievements. ""The results of our statistical analysis seem to suggest that additional financial resources available through tuition fee-funded places improve student performance,"" it said. ""The effects are significant enough to suggest that any move away from the current system of fee-funded places towards an exclusively state-funded system would have some adverse consequences for student achievement."" Hepi's report also found that students were more likely to drop out of university if they were aged over 21 or had less"
politics,Terror Detainees Win Lords Appeal,"Detaining foreign terrorist suspects without trial breaks human rights laws, the UK's highest court has ruled. In a blow to the government's anti-terror measures, the House of Lords law lords ruled by an eight to one majority in favour of appeals by nine detainees. Most of the men are being indefinitely held in Belmarsh prison, south London. The law lords said the measures were incompatible with European human rights laws. The men will stay behind bars while ministers decide how to react. The ruling creates a major problem for Charles Clarke on his first day as home secretary following David Blunkett's resignation. The Liberal Democrats say Mr Clarke should use the fact he is new to the job to take issue with a law established by his predecessor, David Blunkett. Belmarsh prison has been dubbed Britain's Guantanamo Bay by civil rights campaigners opposed to the use of emergency anti-terror laws. The detainees took their case to the House of Lords after the Court of Appeal backed the Home Office's powers to hold them without limit or charge. The government opted out of part of the European Convention on Human Rights concerning the right to a fair trial in order to bring in anti-terrorism legislation in response to the 11 September attacks in the US. Any foreign national suspected of links with terrorism can be detained or can opt to be deported. However those detained cannot be deported if this would mean persecution in their homeland. On Thursday, senior law lord Lord Bingham said the rules were incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights as they allowed detentions ""in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status"". Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, in his ruling, said: ""Indefinite imprisonment without charge or trial is anathema in any country which observes the rule of law. ""It deprives the detained person of the protection a criminal trial is intended to afford."" He said the weakness for the government's case was that it was trying to justify detention without trial for foreign suspects - but not for British suspects. Lord Hoffmann said: ""The real threat to the life of the nation, in the sense of a people living in accordance with its traditional laws and political values, comes not from terrorism but from laws such as these."" But Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe, the one law lord to oppose the appeal, said the anti-terror laws contained important safeguards against oppression. In a statement, detainee 'A' in Woodhill Prison said: ""I hope now that the government will act upon this decision, scrap this illegal 'law' and release me and the other internees to return to our families and loved ones."" The case was heard by a panel of nine law lords rather than the usual five because of the constitutional importance of the case. Ben Emmerson QC, representing seven of the detainees, said the men had already been in custody for nearly three years. He said they had been given no idea when, if ever, they would be released, had never been formally interviewed and there was no prospect they would ever be put on trial. When the men were first held, they took their cases to the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC). The commission ruled on 30 July, 2002 that the anti-terror act unjustifiably discriminated against foreign nationals as British people could not be held in the same way. But that ruling was later overturned by the Court of Appeal who said there was a state of emergency threatening the life of the nation.","Terror suspects held for more than four months without charge have lost their legal battle at the House of Lords. By a majority of eight to three, the UK's highest court rejected the men's claim that their human rights were being breached. The group argued that detaining them beyond the current 28-day limit was unlawful. But Lord Phillips, president of the supreme court, said there was a ""strong public interest"" in allowing police to continue questioning suspects beyond 28 days. He said the current situation was ""unsatisfactory"" and urged Parliament to resolve the issue. The men - including two Britons - were arrested in August 2004 in connection with alleged terrorist plots. The BBC understands that about 10 other suspects are being questioned in similar circumstances. The nine men who lost the case had their applications to have the case heard in open court rejected. Lord Hope, who voted with the majority, said that publicity would put ""undue pressure"" on the police officers who were questioning them. The three judges who voted against said that was ""disturbing"". Liberty, which represented all nine men, argued that detaining them without charge was discriminatory and unfair. The Campaign Against Terrorism Arraignment for Liberty (Catsal) group also argued that, as non-British residents, they had fewer rights than British citizens. But Lord Carswell said: ""The fact that they are non-citizens does not make it right to subject them to a regime of indefinite detention."" As things stand, police can question terror"
politics,Donor Attacks Blair-Brown 'Feud',"The reported feud between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown has prompted a Labour donor to say he will almost certainly refuse to give more funds. Duncan Bannatyne also attacked the government over Iraq and its ""poor"" response to the Asian tsunami crisis. His broadside came as ex-Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said he hoped Mr Brown would be premier at some point. Mr Bannatyne has previously given Labour £50,000. He made his fortune from care homes and health clubs. The 52-year-old on Tuesday said was he was reviewing his donations because of Cabinet disunity and international issues. His spokesman said it was highly unlikely he would give Labour more money, although he would remain a supporter and not fund the Conservatives. Robert Peston's new book has prompted more speculation about the Blair-Brown rift with its claims that the prime minister broke a promise made in 2003 to stand down. Mr Bannatyne said: ""Disunity in the Cabinet has a corrosive effect on the country. ""Gordon Brown is a great chancellor who has delivered a stable economy, but business wants that to continue and not be blown off course by petty squabbles based on personal ambition."" The businessman, whose latest venture is a casino in Newcastle, also voiced concern about the ongoing violence in Iraq. And he branded the UK government's response to the tsunami as ""piecemeal and poor"". ""The people there need practical help not just pledges of money,"" he said. ""The US has forces helping on the ground - we can do more."" British Navy ships have helped the relief effort and the prime minister has said the government could ultimately give hundreds of millions of pounds in aid. Mr Bannatyne is due to host a new television programme and is also appearing on BBC2 business start-up programme Dragon's Den. But his spokesman insisted his attack on Labour was not a publicity stunt. In a separate development, Robin Cook gave his support to Mr Brown's prime ministerial ambitions but told a lunch for political journalists winning the election had to be Labour's election. But he insisted the recent squabbles between Mr Blair and Mr Brown were not ""perceived as a problem by the voters,"" adding there was no impression of governmental incompetence. Mr Cook argued that more prominence was given to these matters because there was ""not an alternative source of opposition to the government"". He warned the ""Abstentions Party"" was the real challenge to Labour - and they would not be motivated by Mr Blair's promise to produce an ""unremittingly New Labour"" election manifesto. His comments come after Dave Prentis, the leader of Britain's biggest union Unison, told the Daily Record newspaper he wants a date to be set for Mr Blair to be replaced as Labour leader.","Tony Blair has denied claims of a rift with Gordon Brown as Labour's biggest donor Lord Sainsbury launched a fresh attack on the chancellor. Lord Sainsbury, the supermarket magnate and science minister, used a newspaper article to accuse Mr Brown of ""unforgivable"" behaviour in the run up to the 1997 election. He also said that he once thought Tony Blair would be a disaster but was now ""delighted"" with him. But Lord Sainsbury also hinted at differences of opinion with Mr Blair over the euro, saying it was still possible to stay out of the single currency. The peer - one of Labour's biggest donors - used a column in the Financial Times to praise Mr Blair and renew his backing for him ahead of next year's general election. But he also launched a stinging attack on Mr Brown, saying he had been guilty of ""disgraceful"" behaviour in the run up to the 1997 election when he was shadow chancellor. ""He was determined to win at any cost and, if I am honest, so was I,"" wrote Lord Sainsbury. ""But I could never have imagined how unforgivable his actions were to be."" ""Our policy, for example, on taxation was not finalised until the day before we launched our manifesto,"" he said. He also said Mr Brown had been responsible for changing Labour's policy from backing tax cuts to supporting increases in order to pay for better public services. He added: ""I did not know"
politics,'Hitler' Row Over Welsh Arts Cash,"An artist critical of Welsh arts funding being brought under assembly government control has denied comparing the idea with dictatorships in Russia and Germany. Shani Rhys James is worried that the Arts Council of Wales may be taken over by the Welsh Assembly Government. Culture Minister Alun Pugh said it would be ""crass and ignorant"" to liken a quango review to Hitler's Germany. But Ms James emphasised she had actually said artists needed freedom. The future of the Arts Council of Wales has been in question since it was announced that most Welsh quangos would eventually be abolished. It was announced last July that three Welsh quangos, education and training body Elwa, the Wales Tourist Board and the Welsh Development Agency, would be brought under assembly government control. The Arts Council of Wales may be among the next to come under the assembly government's umbrella. But Ms James, who won the £30,000 Jerwood painting prize in 2003, said arts funding should be separate from government. Ms James told BBC Radio Wales: ""It's quite dangerous when you involve politicians because it's not like the health service and it's not like the railways. ""Free expression is absolutely vital in a democratic society. You need distance, you do not need government interference because it could be taken the wrong way."" But she said reports that she had likened the assembly government to totalitarian regimes were inaccurate. She told Good Morning Wales: ""Just to put the record straight, that business in the paper where it said I likened the government to Bolshevik Russia or Hitler's Germany, the actual quote I gave was: 'It is vital to a civilised society that we allow artists to express themselves without government control'. ""As we know from past European history, i.e. Russia and Germany in the early 20th Century, artists will go underground or leave the country or rather than compromise their expression'. ""Artists need a free voice to express themselves - they reflect a truth through their own art forms.'"" She said the assembly government was not best placed to run the arts in Wales. She added: ""It would be a momentous change and devastating to the arts. It would set the arts scene back 60 years, because I really don't think the government has the expertise. ""If you have the National Assembly taking control, I fear you are going to be going back to the dragons and leeks and the choirs. ""Wales has moved on. It is international now. It is not set back in How Green Was My Valley?"" Responding to Ms James' criticisms, Mr Pugh said: ""The structure of unelected quangos is under review and we have made it clear that further announcements are due shortly. ""Comparing the Welsh Assembly Government to Hitler's Germany is a crass and ignorant response to a real issue about democratic accountability."" Ms James, whose father was Welsh, was born in Melbourne where her parents worked in the theatre. She moved to Powys nearly 20 years ago where she works from her studio near Llangadfan. She has won a number of arts prizes including the Wales Open in 1989 and the Mostyn Open in 1991.","Arts minister Tessa Blackhouse has been accused of ""scandalous abuse of power"" over plans to give £400,000 to a Third Reich drama. Leighton Andrews, Labour assembly opposition leader, said Tessa Blackhouse was ""obsessed"" with opera and ballet. Ms Blackhouse had earlier denied her decision to veto funding for a Welsh National Opera (WNO) opera was a personal vendetta. WNO's The Opera of The Nameless One is based on a book by Hitler's bodyguard. But Mr Andrews said: ""If there was any other minister in her place, I believe we would have received the £400,000."" The funding was given by Ms Blackhouse to a Welsh language play to mark the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. Mr Andrews said: ""Now she has said that play will be presented at the Wales Millennium Centre and she will use police officers as ushers. ""This is scandalous."" He said he did not object to the play but Ms Blackhouse had ""abused"" her power to prevent WNO staging The Opera of the New Chance. He added: ""The assembly voted unanimously to support this opera on the understanding that it would be performed in full. ""But today we have learnt that the opera will be performed in truncated form and only in Welsh with English subtitles. This is not acceptable."" WNO has denied claims it was going back on a promise to stage the full opera in English as well as in"
politics,Budget To Set Scene For Election,"Gordon Brown will seek to put the economy at the centre of Labour's bid for a third term in power when he delivers his ninth Budget at 1230 GMT. He is expected to stress the importance of continued economic stability, with low unemployment and interest rates. The chancellor is expected to freeze petrol duty and raise the stamp duty threshold from £60,000. But the Conservatives and Lib Dems insist voters face higher taxes and more means-testing under Labour. Treasury officials have said there will not be a pre-election giveaway, but Mr Brown is thought to have about £2bn to spare. - Increase in the stamp duty threshold from £60,000 - A freeze on petrol duty - An extension of tax credit scheme for poorer families - Possible help for pensioners The stamp duty threshold rise is intended to help first time buyers - a likely theme of all three of the main parties' general election manifestos. Ten years ago, buyers had a much greater chance of avoiding stamp duty, with close to half a million properties, in England and Wales alone, selling for less than £60,000. Since then, average UK property prices have more than doubled while the starting threshold for stamp duty has not increased. Tax credits As a result, the number of properties incurring stamp duty has rocketed as has the government's tax take. The Liberal Democrats unveiled their own proposals to raise the stamp duty threshold to £150,000 in February. The Tories are also thought likely to propose increased thresholds, with shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin branding stamp duty a ""classic Labour stealth tax"". The Tories say whatever the chancellor gives away will be clawed back in higher taxes if Labour is returned to power. Shadow Treasury chief secretary George Osborne said: ""Everyone who looks at the British economy at the moment says there has been a sharp deterioration in the public finances, that there is a black hole,"" he said. ""If Labour is elected there will be a very substantial tax increase in the Budget after the election, of the order of around £10bn."" But Mr Brown's former advisor Ed Balls, now a parliamentary hopeful, said an examination of Tory plans for the economy showed there would be a £35bn difference in investment by the end of the next parliament between the two main parties. He added: ""I don't accept there is any need for any changes to the plans we have set out to meet our spending commitments."" For the Lib Dems David Laws said: ""The chancellor will no doubt tell us today how wonderfully the economy is doing,"" he said. ""But a lot of that is built on an increase in personal and consumer debt over the last few years - that makes the economy quite vulnerable potentially if interest rates ever do have to go up in a significant way."" SNP leader Alex Salmond said his party would introduce a £2,000 grant for first time buyers, reduce corporation tax and introduce a citizens pension free from means testing. Plaid Cymru's economics spokesman Adam Price said he wanted help to get people on the housing ladder and an increase in the minimum wage to £5.60 an hour.","Chancellor Gordon Brown will set out his plans for the next four years in his Pre-Budget Report on Wednesday. Ahead of the big day, BBC News looks at the key issues likely to be addressed. FISCAL POLICY How far will the chancellor stick to his golden rule that says the government should balance its books over the economic cycle? Mr Brown has already said that he will not be cutting spending in 2005/06 and he may also use his pre-Budget report to announce that he has met his target two years early, having closed a £23bn gap in 2004/05. His critics say this has been done by fiddling the figures and there is speculation that he could use Wednesday's report to provide more detail on how he intends to meet his target. Instead of balancing the books over the economic cycle, many economists would like Mr Brown to run a small deficit to help stimulate the economy. But the chancellor is unlikely to change course in Wednesday's report, preferring to keep his options open for an election campaign which is likely to centre on who can offer voters the best economic management. The Conservatives have promised to stick to Mr Brown's rules if they win power, although leader Michael Howard has said he would like to see ""a more flexible approach"". The Liberal Democrats have suggested they would run a budget surplus of 1% of GDP per year. What is unlikely to be mentioned in Wednesday's report is any more detail on how Mr Brown plans to fund public sector pensions."
politics,'Debate Needed' On Donations Cap,"A cap on donations to political parties should not be introduced yet, the elections watchdog has said. Fears that big donors can buy political favours have sparked calls for a limit. In a new report, the Electoral Commission says it is worth debating a £10,000 cap for the future but now is not the right time to introduce it. It also says there should be more state funding for political parties and candidates should be able to spend more on election campaigning. There were almost £68m in reported donations to political parties in 2001, 2002 and 2003, with nearly £12m of them from individual gifts worth more than £1m. The rules have already been changed so the public can see who gives how much to the parties but the report says there are still public suspicions. The commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash - something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work. ""While we are not in principle opposed to the introduction of a donation cap, we do not believe that such a major departure from the existing system now would be sensible,"" says its report. If there was to be a cap, it should be £10,000 - a small enough amount to make a difference but which would have banned £56m in donations between 2001 and 2003. Even without changes the commission does urge political parties to seek out more small-scale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under £200. It also suggests increasing state funding for parties to £3m so help can be extended to all parties with at least two members in the House of Commons, European Parliament, Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly or Northern Ireland Assembly. And it suggests new ways of boosting election campaigning, seen as a way of improving voter turnout. All local election candidates should be entitled to a free mailshot for campaign leaflets, says the watchdog. And there should be a shift in the amount of money allowed to be spent at elections from a national level to a local level to help politicians engage better with voters. The report suggests doubling the money which can be spent by candidates, while cutting national spending limits from £20m to £15m. The commission also says the spending limits for general elections should cover the four months before the poll - as happens with other elections. Electoral Commission chairman Sam Younger said: ""There is no doubt that political parties have a vital role to play in maintaining the health of our democracy and for this they need to be adequately resourced. ""Our research has shown that people want to be more informed about party politics and that they want politicians to be more visible and accessible. ""The public are reluctant for the state to fund parties but at the same time are unhappy with large private donations."" He called for a wider public debate on party funding to find the consensus needed for radical changes to the current system.","A cap on political donations should be debated, says a senior MP on the parliamentary committee examining the issue. Labour backbencher Joan Ryan said there had to be limits to stop rich people buying political influence. But she warned against any legislation which would damage free speech. The committee is examining how to reform party funding as Labour's limits on individual donations are due to expire in April. The committee of MPs and peers is considering whether a statutory limit should be imposed on all donations, how this could be enforced and the implications for free speech and the right to privacy. All three parties have been embarrassed by the scale of donations which were legally allowed before the 2002 Act which placed a limit of £5,000 on individual gifts to parties. Ms Ryan told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think we need to do have a debate about whether there should be a cap or not, but I think we need to look very carefully at what the implications of that would be."" She said there was a world of difference between political parties and newspapers like the Daily Mail, The Sun or The Mirror which were ""not campaigning organisations"". ""They are entitled to say what they want to say, however offensive it might be, however much it might distort the truth."" She said there was ""no doubt"" that some people had sought to distort the political process by making big donations. ""What is critical is that we don't go down the American model of having loads of money being poured into political campaigns."" She said"
sport,Ferrero Eyes Return To Top Form,"Former world number one Juan Carlos Ferrero insists he can get back to his best despite a tough start to 2005. The 2003 French Open champion has slipped to 64 in the world after a year of illness and injuries in 2004, but is confident that his form will return. ""I don't know when it is going to happen,"" Ferrero told BBC Sport. ""But I have a lot of confidence in me that I will be the same Juan Carlos as I was before, and very soon. I feel 100% again mentally."" The 25-year-old Spaniard joins a top field for the ABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament in Rotterdam this week as he looks to add to just two wins in 2005. He opens against Rainer Schuettler and potentially faces fourth seed David Nalbandian in the second round. ""Because I'm no longer seeded it's tougher,"" Ferrero admitted. ""I had to play against Joachim Johansson in the first round last week in Marseille. ""In the past when I was a top seed I would have played a match like that in the quarters or semi-finals. ""This is the big difference but I have to do it to get higher in the rankings."" Despite this, Ferrero insists he is feeling positive after chicken pox and a rib injury destroyed last season. ""Physically I am 100% since December of last year,"" said Ferrero. ""I was working very hard before the Davis Cup final to prepare and I've felt 100% from then until now. ""The difficult moments were when I knew that I had the chicken pox and that it would take two or three months to recover. ""I had to start from zero again physically because the virus left me at zero per cent. ""When I started to come back I had my rib broken when I fell on court and that was another two months out. Those five months were pretty difficult for me."" Among the low points of a difficult year for Ferrero was the decision of Spain captain Jordi Arrese to drop him for the Davis Cup final against the USA. ""It was difficult because I had been playing well for the whole year and the coaches told me that I would play,"" said Ferrero. ""But then I had some problems with my hand two days before the Friday matches so they decided to choose Nadal instead. ""It was difficult for me not to be in the Friday matches but I had to understand. ""Inside me I wanted to play but this was the decision of the captain and they had to make it.""","Ferrero, the world number four, has revealed he is close to a return to top form following knee surgery. The Spaniard, who will play in next week's Mercedes-Benz Championship, has not played since August due to the injury. ""I am very pleased with the way things are going,"" said the 26-year-old. ""I am hitting the ball well and my movement is improving all the time."" Ferrero, who has dropped to fourth in the world rankings, won his first Grand Slam title at last year's US Open. But he pulled out of this year's Australian Open due to his knee problem and was also absent from both the recent Davis Cup and Masters Cup tournaments. ""It has been a frustrating period for me,"" added Ferrero. ""But I feel confident that I will soon be back to complete fitness."" Ferrero will play in next week's Mercedes-Benz Championship at Mission Hills Country Club in China along with Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski. Other players taking part include world number one Roger Federer, Andre Agassi and Lleyton Hewitt."
sport,Greek Pair Attend Drugs Hearing,"Greek sprinters Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou have appeared before an independent tribunal which will decide if their bans should stand. They were given provisional suspensions by athletics' ruling body the IAAF in December for failing to take drugs tests before the Athens Olympics. The pair arrived with former coach Christos Tzekos to give evidence at the Hellenic Olympic Committee's offices. A decision is expected to be announced before the end of February. Whatever the ruling, all parties will have the right to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Yiannis Papadoyiannakis, who was head of the Greek Olympic team at the Athens Games last year, also testified at the tribunal, along with other Greek sports officials and athletes. ""I believe the tribunal will reach a decision that will uphold the standing of the institution,"" said Papadoyiannakis. ""Whatever the athletes have done, we must not forget that they have offered us great moments."" Kenteris won 200m gold at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, while Thanou won silver in the 100m. They withdrew from the Athens Games last August after missing drugs tests on the eve of the opening ceremony. The pair spent four days in a hospital, claiming they had been injured in a motorcycle crash. The five-member tribunal, assembled by the Hellenic Association of Amateur Athletics, is also examining allegations that Kenteris and Thanou avoided tests in Tel Aviv and Chicago before the Games. Tzekos was also banned for two years by the IAAF. He faces charges of assisting in the use of prohibited substances and tampering with the doping inspection process. All three, who have repeatedly denied the allegations, have also been charged by a Greek prosecutor and face trial for doping-related charges. A trial date has not been set. In imposing two-year suspensions on the duo on 22 December, the IAAF described their explanations for missing the tests as ""unacceptable"". But Kenteris' lawyer Gregory Ioannidis told BBC Sport earlier this week he was confident the sprinters would be cleared of the charges of failing to give information on their location and refusing to submit to testing. ""We refute both charges as unsubstantiated and illogical,"" he said. ""There have been certain breaches in the correct application of the rules on behalf of the sporting authorities and their officials, and these procedural breaches have also violated my client's rights. ""There is also evidence that proves the fact that my client has been persecuted.""","Two Greek suspects in the doping inquiry due to appear before a UK drugs test panel have been ordered to attend. Evangelos Dellas and Kostas Frantzeskos are among five named Greeks due at the London hearing on Thursday. They are expected to face questions about their alleged involvement in the systematic use of drugs in Greek athletics. All five have denied wrongdoing. Dellas and Frantzeskos will be joined by Theodoros Sidiropoulos, Ioannis Georgiou, and Athanasia Michali. Dellas, Frantzeskos, Sidiropoulos and Georgiou were questioned in Athens last month by German judge Hans Eysenck, who is heading the UK inquiry on behalf of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). Michali is expected to be questioned by telephone link. The IAAF wants to ban the five from athletics and strip them of any medals won if they are found guilty of drug abuse. Dellas and Frantzeskos retired from athletics in 1999. Both ran in the marathon at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney where Dellas finished 12th and Frantzeskos 27th. Dellas has denied ever taking performance-enhancing drugs. ""I have never taken any banned substances,"" he told reporters after being questioned in Athens last month. ""I hope that everything will be clarified as soon as possible because this situation is harming my career, my family, and myself."" Frantzeskos also denied ever using banned substances but admitted"
sport,Italy 8-38 Wales,"Wales secured their first away win in the RBS Six Nations for nearly four years with a six-try victory in Rome. Tries from Jonathan Thomas, Tom Shanklin and Martyn Williams gave the visitors a 19-5 half-time advantage. Luciano Orquera did reply with one for Italy but second-half efforts from Brent Cockbain, Shane Williams and Robert Sidoli sealed victory. Fly-half Stephen Jones added four conversions as Wales maintained their superb start to this year's tournament. Starting full of confidence after their victory over England, the visitors scored the opening try after just four minutes. Diminutive wing Shane Williams fielded a kick ahead and danced past the onrushing Andrea Masi and Aaron Persico into the Italian half. His pass to Tom Shanklin appeared forward but when the centre was held up short, the ball was switched left and Michael Owen's long cut-out pass gave the lurking Thomas an easy run-in. Stephen Jones, who retained the kicking duties despite Gavin Henson's heroics against England, slotted an excellent conversion from wide out. Wales twice threatened further scores but failed to find the crucial pass, and Italy hit back out of the blue in the 11th minute. Henson, sporting gold boots rather than the silver variety that did for England, beat two players with ease out on the left touchline. But his attempted chip ahead was charged down by Orquera, who snaffled the loose ball and hared away from halfway to score in the right corner. With the Welsh line-out stuttering and Italy twice turning the visitors' scrum, the home side's forward power brought them back into it. But a clever high kick from Henson almost brought a try for Hal Luscombe when Roland de Marigny and Ludovico Nitoglia made a hash of claiming it as the ball bounced into touch. Wales regained control with a second try in the 21st minute, Henson lobbing up a high kick to the left corner where Shanklin jumped higher than Nitoglia to dot down his 15th Test try. Jones was unable to convert and De Marigny then hit the upright with a penalty attempt for Italy. Henson was also narrowly short with a long-range effort at goal, but Wales ended the half with a vital third score to give themselves some breathing space. Henson sent Luscombe streaking away and when he off-loaded to Martyn Williams, the flanker showed his nous to ground the ball against the padding of the post, Jones adding the conversion. Italy, who lost flanker Mauro Bergamasco with a head knock before half-time, built up a head of steam on the resumption. De Marigny landed a penalty to make it 19-8 and a Nitoglia break through the middle threatened a try only for the move to break down with a knock-on. But Wales put the outcome beyond doubt with two superb tries in four minutes before the hour. Their fourth after 53 minutes was sparked by another mazy run from Shane Williams, who beat several players with ease, and finished with a powerful angled run from lock Cockbain. Before Italy could recover from that blow, a strong surge from Gareth Thomas and great off-loads from Martyn Williams and replacement Kevin Morgan saw Shane Williams scamper over. With Jones converting both for a 33-8 lead, Wales had the luxury of sending on five more replacements for the final quarter. The icing on the cake came with a sixth try after more superb support work, Shane Williams and Ceri Sweeney combining to send Sidoli over in the left corner. The only downside for Wales was a hamstring injury suffered by Luscombe. But after back-to-back wins at the start of the tournament for the first time in 11 years, they will travel to Paris in a fortnight looking like genuine contenders.

Italy had kept Wales scoreless for the first 55 minutes of the Six Nations clash in Rome but the hosts were blown away by a Welsh avalanche. Gethin Jenkins and James Hook kicked early penalties for Wales before Italy took control with Carlo del Fava's try. Fabio Capello's side were camped inside the Wales half for long periods but errors wrecked their chances. Del Fava's try came from a driving maul and although Italy led 8-3, Wales were camped on their line for long periods without being breached. But after a period of dominance for Italy, Wales hit back with two tries in two minutes just before half-time. Nikki Walker raced over from 60 metres after Gareth Thomas had been turned over on the halfway line, and then Stephen Jones darted clear after a driving maul. Jenkins added the extras and then kicked a penalty after half-time to put Wales 12 points ahead. But Italy came again and centre Andrea Masi darted over after a brilliant driving maul to get his side back into the game at 12-8. But Wales, who had dominated possession and territory, went on to score five further tries in a one-sided game.

sport,Running Around The Olympics,"It was back to official duties last week in my role as an ambassador to London's 2012 Olympic bid. But I still managed to do all my marathon training. All the sporting people on the capital's bid team think I'm mad to be taking part in the London Marathon. The bid chairman, Lord Coe, admitted he would never dream of running a marathon, even though he was an Olympic middle-distance runner. Kelly Holmes, former hurdler Alan Pascoe and former sprinter Frankie Fredericks - who is now an IOC member - all wanted to know why anyone would want to run that far. You'd have thought all these athletes, who have been running for most of their lives, wouldn't think it would be that bad. But the only person who was positive about my intentions was Tanni Grey Thompson, who has won the London Marathon wheelchair race six times. Even though it was a very busy week entertaining the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) Evaluation Commission, I actually found my running schedule easier to follow. When I'm at home, I get distracted by all sorts of things but for the five days I was in London, I was in a pressurised situation, but I found it easy to relax by running. On Wednesday, the presentations to the IOC team did not finish until the early evening, so I just managed to squeeze in a 45-minute run. We had an early start on Thursday because we had to visit all the Olympic sites around London, that was pretty shattering, but when we got back to the hotel, I got back on the treadmill. On Friday evening I went along to the special dinner at Buckingham Palace which was a nice occasion. I never feel guilty about eating, especially when I'm exercising. And because it was a rest day I didn't have to feel bad about missing my training either. Anyway, I managed to do another quick run on Saturday ahead of the final IOC presentations, before heading home for my daughter's birthday. When I was in London I did all of my runs on the treadmill, which isn't the same as exercising outdoors. One of the IOC's technical staff from Australia ran alongside me one day. We talked about the Sydney Olympics and that made the time go past more quickly. I do find it quite comfortable running in the gym because there is more cushioning. But when you're gearing up to running on the road you need your body to get used to that jarring feeling when your feet hit the pavement. It was good to get out on the road for my long run on Sunday. After the week I'd had I was a bit concerned I wouldn't be able to complete it. But I coped with it very well and, even though it was bitterly cold, I put in 15-and-a-half miles - only another 11 to go then. - This year Steve will donate all the proceeds from his London Marathon efforts to victims of the tsunami.Steve will be writing a regular column on the ups and downs of his marathon training for the BBC Sport website.He will be raising money through the Steve Redgrave Trust which supports the Association of Children's Hospices, the Children With Leukaemia charity, and the Trust's own project which aims to provide inner-city schools with rowing equipment.","Running is probably the easiest sport to watch at the Olympics because you don't need to know a thing about athletics to appreciate it. Unlike in swimming or gymnastics, a viewer doesn't have to know about strokes or apparatus to follow the progress of a race. The runners set off and we simply watch them until someone crosses the line first. Anybody can do it. And that is why athletics is one of the most popular sports at the Olympics. It is also the sport that captures the imagination most in terms of betting. Odds on the outcome of individual races are offered by bookmakers and punters around the world. Bookmakers in the UK, for example, say that they take more bets on athletics than on any other sport at the Games. That may be partly because athletics is so accessible to viewers. But it is also because its appeal is so basic. The drama of athletics stems from watching two individuals pit their wits against each other. Other events, such as team sports and swimming, are harder for viewers to follow in a straightforward manner because there are more than two competitors involved. Spectators at events such as football and rugby have to work out which of two teams will win a match or a competition. But in track and field, spectators can simply decide who they think will win an individual race or contest and back that outcome with cash. The simplicity of athletics, therefore, means it is a sport that viewers can relate to better than others when placing bets. As well as simple"
sport,O'Driscoll Saves Irish Blushes,"Two moments of magic from Brian O'Driscoll guided Ireland to a workmanlike victory against Italy. A pair of classic outside breaks from the Ireland captain set up tries for Geordan Murphy and Peter Stringer. Italy led 9-8 early in the second half but Stringer's try gave Ireland a lead they never lost. The hosts cut the gap to 18-12 with 10 minutes left and nearly scored through Ludovico Nitoglia, but Denis Hickie's try ensured an Irish victory. Italy came flying out of the blocks and took the lead through a Luciano Orquera penalty after seven minutes. It could have been better for the hosts but the fly-half missed two kickable penalties and Ireland drew level with a Ronan O'Gara penalty midway through the first half. The Italians were driving at the heart of the Irish defence and, for the first quarter, the Irish pack struggled to secure any ball for their talented backs. When they finally did, just before the half-hour mark, O'Driscoll promptly created a sparkling try for Murphy. The Ireland captain ran a dummy scissors and made a magical outside break before drawing the full-back and putting the diving Murphy in at the corner. O'Gara missed the twice-taken conversion and the visitors found themselves trailing once again. Roland de Marigny took over the kicking duties for Italy from the hapless Orquera, and he landed a penalty either side of the break to edge Italy into a 9-8 lead. The only Ireland player offering a real threat was O'Driscoll, and it was his break that set up the second try for the visitors. Shane Horgan threw an overhead pass as he was about to be forced into touch and Stringer scooted over, with O'Gara landing the tricky conversion. A penalty apiece saw Ireland leading 18-12 as the game entered the final quarter, but they were lucky to survive when Italy launched a series of attacks. Winger Nitoglia dropped the ball as he reached for the line and Italy nearly rumbled over from a driving maul. An O'Gara penalty put Ireland more than a converted try ahead and they made the game safe when Hickie latched onto an inside pass from Murphy and crossed for a converted try. O'Driscoll limped off late on, joining centre partner Gordon D'Arcy on the sidelines, and the final word went to Italy. Prop Martin Castrogiovanni powered over for a try which was fitting reward for an Italian pack which had kept the Irish under pressure throughout.

The world's best outside-half, Ronan O'Gara, had spotted a gap at pace and dived for the line. But O'Driscoll intervened with a magnificent open-field hit that would have graced any sport. The tackle was even more remarkable given that O'Driscoll only returned to action three weeks ago after a six-month lay-off with knee ligament damage. The Ireland captain's return has been a major boost to his side who were struggling to contain Les Bleus in the early exchanges. France had dominated possession and territory in the opening minutes and were preparing to add to their opening score when O'Driscoll halted the charge of Sebastien Chabal. Ireland coach Eddie O'Sullivan said: ""If you'd offered us one try at kick-off we'd have taken it. ""It was a fantastic opening 20 minutes from us and we came out of it only six points adrift which was a great effort from the lads. ""At half-time we were looking at a possible bonus point victory which, given the injury problems we've been battling with, would have been fantastic.

sport,Dawson Wins England Squad Recall,"Wasps scrum-half Matt Dawson has been recalled to England's training squad ahead of the RBS Six Nations and been reinstated in the Elite Player Squad. Coach Andy Robinson dropped Dawson for the autumn Tests after he missed training to film 'A Question of Sport.' ""I always said I would consider bringing Matt back if I felt he was playing well,"" Robinson said. ""He merits his return on current form."" Newcastle's 18-year-old centre Mathew Tait is also in the training squad. ""It's obviously an honour to be asked to train with England,"" said Tait, who has burst into contention recently. ""I look forward to going down and doing the sessions, but the most important thing at the moment is Sunday's game against Newport, so I'm not looking any further than that."" Robinson has invited 42 players to attend a three-day session in Leeds next week, in which his squad will train in part with the Leeds Rhinos rugby league squad. With Mike Tindall ruled out of the opening two matches and Will Greenwood sidelined for the entire Six Nations, Tait is one of six or seven contenders for the two centre berths. Stuart Abbott, Jamie Noon, Ollie Smith, Olly Barkley and Henry Paul - who retains his place despite his early substitution against Australia - are also in the mix. Ben Cohen could also be considered after switching from the wing for his club Northampton recently. Prop Phil Vickery and lock Simon Shaw both return to the squad after missing the autumn Tests through injury, while Wasps wing Tom Voyce is recalled. The group also includes Bath flanker Andy Beattie and Leicester hooker George Chuter. ""Beattie has matured greatly as a player these past two seasons,"" Robinson said. Jonny Wilkinson, Tindall and Martin Corry have all been included despite their unavailability for the opening two matches against Wales and France. The revised 56-man elite squad includes Wasps hooker Phil Greening, who replaces the retired Mark Regan, and Sale wing Mark Cueto. Cueto was selected for the November internationals despite not being part of the group, but scored four tries in three England appearances. Leicester scrum-half Harry Ellis has also been promoted from the senior national academy, and will contest the number nine jersey with Dawson and Gloucester's Andy Gomarsall. The players in Robinson's elite squad can only play 32 matches for club and country. They can be called up for a total of 16 training days in addition to the recognised international weeks for each of the years leading up to the next World Cup.

sport,O'Sullivan Keeps His Powder Dry,"When you are gunning for glory and ultimate success keeping the gunpowder dry is essential. Ireland coach Eddie O'Sullivan appears to have done that quite successfully in the run-up to this season's Six Nations Championship. He decreed after the 2003 World Cup that players should have a decent conditioning period during the year. That became a reality at the end of last summer with a 10-week period at the start of the this season. It may have annoyed his Scottish, and in particularly Welsh, cousins who huffed and puffed at the disrespect apparently shown to the Celtic League. We will say nothing of Mike Ruddock ''poaching'' eight of the Dragons side that faced Leinster on Sunday. But, like O'Sullivan, he was well within his rights, particularly when you are talking about the national side and pride that goes along with it. The IRFU has thrown their weight behind O'Sullivan, who must be glad that in the main, there is centrally-controlled contracts. Bar Keith Gleeson who is just returning from a broken leg, everyone of O'Sullivan's squad is fit, fresh and standing at the oche ready to launch this season's campaign. But I doubt whether O'Sullivan is going to gloat about the handling of his players. He is not that sort of person. However, he may look at the overworked and injury-hit England, Wales and France squads whose players have been overworked, and then pat himself on the back for his foresight. But there is still the question of turning up and transferring that freshness into positive results when the referee signals the start of the game. Already Ireland are being earmarked as hot favourites in many quarters to go the whole hog this season. A first Grand Slam since Karl Mullen's led the team to a clean sweep in 1948. With England and France visiting Lansdowne Road for the last time before the old darling is pulled down, everything looks perfectly placed. But in the days of yore that frightened the life out of any Irishman. Under the burden of great expectations, Ireland have crumpled. Take the Triple Crown-winning side of 1985 under Mick Doyle. They were expected to up the ante further for a Grand Slam, only the second in Ireland's history. What happened in 1986? Whitewashed. You see, Ireland, in any sport, love to be downsized. Then they can go out and prove a point to the contrary. It is the nature of the beast. But O'Sullivan's side are very capable of proving a salient point this season. After their first Triple Crown for 19 years, they can live up to their success and take a further step up the ladder. O'Sullivan has kept faith and displayed loyalty to his players, and they have repaid him in spades ... and there is more to come. He has some old dogs in his squad, but he will come to this season's championship with a different box of tricks, and a new verve to succeed. Ireland can indeed succeed, but just whisper it.","Ronnie O'Sullivan says he will not know whether he is fit to play in the Masters until 24 hours before the start of the tournament. The world number two has a calf injury but says he will ""give it a go"" at Wembley Arena. O'Sullivan added: ""I have to see how I feel on the day. I can't predict what's going to happen."" World champion Graeme Dott will be among his first round opponents if he does play. The Scot pulled out of the tournament on Thursday because of a back injury. O'Sullivan's appearance will depend on how he feels in a practice session on Friday and again in Saturday's warm-up frame. ""It was touch and go for me on Thursday and Friday so we'll just have to see what happens,"" said O'Sullivan. ""When I get there, I'll do a bit of practice and see how I am feeling and then we'll make a final decision on whether I play or not. ""I'm not going to practice too much in case I aggravate it even more."" He added: ""I'm not going to hold myself back if I'm not 100% fit but I'm also not going to waste my money if I'm not feeling good. ""I just want to get there, see how I feel, see how the injury feels and then take it from there."" World number three Shaun Murphy, four-time champion John Higgins, Mark Williams and Jimmy White are among those who"
sport,"Umaga Ready For ""Fearsome"" Lions","All Blacks captain Tama Umaga has warned the British and Irish Lions will be his most fearsome opponents yet ahead of their summer tour. But Umaga, in England for Saturday's IRB Rugby Aid match, also backed New Zealand to win the three-Test series against the Lions. He told BBC Sport: ""It's potentially the most fearsome line-up I've ever come up against. They're awesome. ""But I'd back us all the way to beat them when they come over."" Lions boss Sir Clive Woodward is set to announce his squad for the June-July tour next month. When Woodward was appointed last year, it was widely believed he would rely heavily on his former England players. But Umaga said: ""He'd be hard pushed to do that now considering the shape of the Six Nations. ""Don't get me wrong, England have got a lot of talented guys and I'm sure there are some of them who'll make the Lions Test XV. ""But you can't disguise Wales and Ireland in particular. Some of the tries they've scored have been great. I'll admit it'll be fairly awesome lining up against the likes of Brian O'Driscoll."" Umaga will meet O'Driscoll in Saturday's Rugby Aid match at Twickenham, with the Irish captain leading the Northern Hemisphere side. O'Driscoll is among a host of players in the Northern Hemisphere squad, coached by Woodward, that are tipped for Lions call-ups. ""It'll be good for us to get an early idea of some of these guys, although a lot can change between now and June,"" Umaga said. The 31-year-old admitted interest in the Lions tour was immense, calling it ""the biggest thing to hit New Zealand since Lord of the Rings"". He added: ""As players, it's enough for us to be driven by the rarity of playing the Lions. In fact, it's not just us All Blacks - it's the talk of the country."" Umaga admitted the fear of injury weighed on his mind ahead of Saturday's charity game, which features a host of big names including George Gregan, Andrew Mehrtens and Chris Latham. But he admitted the value of the cause - proceeds of the match will go to aiding victims of the tsunami - easily won him over. ""The second [Southern Hemisphere coach] Rod Macqueen made the approach, I didn't hesitate. It was great when New Zealand Rugby then gave me the all clear. ""Thankfully I didn't know anyone that was involved in the tragedy of the tsunami but you couldn't miss all the horrific reports on the news. ""There are so many people that were affected, are still affected and will be affected for a long time. It's just good to know we can do something minor to help out."" - The match will be televised on BBC One at 1400 GMT on Saturday.","New England coach Brian Ashton has warned his side that a fear of failure can be a powerful motivation for the tourists. The English have struggled to win in Australia and New Zealand in recent years, and face a daunting task against the might of the Lions in Saturday's Aviva Premiership clash. But Ashton, who won three Tests against the Springboks in 1999, says there is nothing like the prospect of losing to inspire his players. ""It's a very important emotion to coaching,"" said Ashton, who took over from Andy Robinson earlier this month. ""Every team I've coached has had a fear of failure and there is always something to drive them on."" The Lions won their opening tour game against the Western Province by a single point, and Ashton says they will provide tough opposition for his struggling Premiership side. ""I think they are formidable,"" he told BBC Radio Five Live. ""They have got real physicality and real pace as well. It will be a real challenge for us."" And Ashton admits he has been keeping a close eye on his new charges since taking charge of the team. ""As a coach you're always watching games anyway,"" he said. ""But I have looked at quite a few Premiership games recently to see how certain players have been playing."" And he is sure that England players like Martin Johnson, Lewis Moody and Ben Kay will relish the chance to pit their wits against some of the world's finest players. ""It's such an exciting opportunity,"" he said. """
sport,Robinson Ready For Difficult Task,"England coach Andy Robinson faces the first major test of his tenure as he tries to get back to winning ways after the Six Nations defeat by Wales. Robinson is likely to make changes in the back row and centre after the 11-9 loss as he contemplates Sunday's set-to with France at Twickenham. Lewis Moody and Martin Corry could both return after missing the game with hamstring and shoulder problems. And the midfield pairing of Mathew Tait and Jamie Noon is also under threat. Olly Barkley immediately allowed England to generate better field position with his kicking game after replacing debutant Tait just before the hour. The Bath fly-half-cum-centre is likely to start against France, with either Tait or Noon dropping out. Tait, given little opportunity to shine in attack, received praise from Robinson afterwards, even if the coach admitted Cardiff was an ""unforgiving place"" for the teenage prodigy. Robinson now has a tricky decision over whether to withdraw from the firing line, after just one outing, a player he regards as central to England's future. Tait himself, at least outwardly, appeared unaffected by the punishing treatment dished out to him by Gavin Henson in particular. ""I want more of that definitely,"" he said. ""Hopefully I can train hard this week and get selected for next week but we'll have to look at the video and wait and see. ""We were playing on our own 22 for a lot of the first half so it was quite difficult. I thought we defended reasonably well but we've just got to pick it up for France."" His Newcastle team-mate Noon hardly covered himself in glory in his first major Test. He missed a tackle on Michael Owen in the build-up to Wales' try, conceded a penalty at the breakdown, was turned over in another tackle and fumbled Gavin Henson's cross-kick into touch, all inside the first quarter. His contribution improved in the second half, but England clearly need more of a playmaker in the inside centre role. Up front, the line-out remains fallible, despite a superb performance from Chris Jones, whose athleticism came to the fore after stepping into the side for Moody. It is more likely the Leicester flanker will return on the open side for the more physical challenge posed by the French forwards, with Andy Hazell likely to make way. Lock Ben Kay also justified his recall with an impressive all-round display on his return to the side, but elsewhere England positives were thin on the ground.","Robinson has warned his Wales team-mates they face their toughest test yet in Saturday's RBS Six Nations clash with title favourites England. The Ospreys flanker, who has won his first cap in the opening two rounds of the championship, is wary of the threat posed by the hosts at Twickenham. ""I think this is going to be the biggest test of our careers,"" said Robinson. ""We are going to have to be at our best and that is a good thing."" Wales have drawn their first two matches of the Six Nations and are still searching for their first win. But Robinson, who has been named on the bench against England, believes there are encouraging signs for coach Mike Ruddock. ""We have played two pretty decent teams in Scotland and Ireland,"" said the 23-year-old. ""In those two games we were probably only two or three points away from winning. ""That is a positive thing because as a team we were starting to feel like we were playing pretty well and not getting any results."" Robinson will join a Welsh back row which also includes Newport Gwent Dragon Simon Taylor and Swansea Harrier Jonathan Thomas. And he insists Wales can take heart from the fact that England have not won at Twickenham since last March. ""Scotland came there and did really well so we can take a lot from that,"" added Robinson. ""They had a chance to win but just let it slip away in the last couple of minutes."" And the 23-year"
sport,Preview: Ireland V England (Sun),"Lansdowne Road, Dublin Sunday, 27 February 1500 GMT BBC1, Radio 4 LW and this website Ireland are going for their first Grand Slam since 1948 after two opening wins, and England represent their sternest test of the Championship so far. England were sloppy and leaderless in the defeats against Wales and France and another loss would be unthinkable. The pressure is on coach Andy Robinson and his side have to deliver. Despite England's dramatic dip in form since the World Cup final - they have lost eight of their last 13 matches - Ireland coach Eddie O'Sullivan says his side should not underestimate the visitors. ""Had they kicked their points they would have beaten France and that would have created a different landscape for Sunday,"" he said. ""This is England we are talking about. They have a depth of talent and a very good record against Ireland. ""They will target a victory in Dublin as the turning point in their Six Nations."" The differences between the sides is also highlighted in the team selections for the Dublin encounter. Ireland, despite having Gordon D'Arcy still out injured, have been boosted by the return of star skipper Brian O'Driscoll who missed the Scotland game with a hamstring injury. ""The knowledge that the England game was coming up really helped during rehabilitation,"" he said. ""The will to play in this game was enormous. It doesn't get much bigger than England at home."" As well as entering the tournament without players like Jonny Wilkinson, Mike Tindall and Richard Hill, England have now lost two tighthead props in Julian White and Phil Vickery while blind-side flanker Lewis Moody is a major concern. Robinson, who received a lot of flak for the inclusion and then dropping of centre Mathew Tait, has kept faith with kicking fly-half Charlie Hodgson despite his horror show at Twickenham. If England slump in Dublin, it will be their worst run of results in the Championship since 1987. But Robinson was bullish during the week about the game, saying that his side ""are going there to get in their faces"", and has identified the line-out and tackle area as the key to England's chances. And despite the recent results, skipper Jason Robinson believes there is nothing wrong with the mood in the camp. ""There is no lack of confidence in the team,"" said the Sale full-back. ""We have had a good week's training and we are all looking forward to the challenge. ""I still believe in this team. I know if we get our game right we will win the games.""

The form book England have won their last three games against Ireland, including last year's Six Nations clash and the World Cup pool match in Melbourne. On that basis they should win by a mile... but it's seldom that simple in rugby. There are a number of reasons why history is unlikely to repeat itself. For a start, England's captain Martin Johnson is likely to be sidelined with a hamstring injury. Apart from his inspirational qualities, Johnson's absence will also rob England of one of the finest locks in world rugby. Ireland, by contrast, have named an unchanged pack for the first time in the tournament. Their forwards are rolling forward, and their backs are clicking into gear too. They have outscored their opponents by seven tries to two during their opening two Six Nations games. And as coach Eddie O'Sullivan has pointed out, England were lucky to escape with a 20-15 victory against Wales in Cardiff. Wales were unlucky not to win, and O'Sullivan knows that is a message which could give Ireland extra motivation. Ireland have also had more time to prepare for the game than England - who had to travel south after beating Scotland on Saturday. In contrast, Ireland have not played since their 20-14 victory over Italy on 4 February. And while England have been on the road both times they have played Ireland, Ireland have"

Other players who have already agreed to play include Leeds and Great Britain rugby league captain Garry Schofield, and former Widnes centre Neil Fox.

sport,Wasps 31-37 Leicester,"Leicester withstood a stunning Wasps comeback to win a pulsating Heineken Cup encounter at the Causeway Stadium. The Tigers stormed 22-6 ahead within 18 minutes through tries from Lewis Moody, Geordan Murphy and Martin Corry. European champions Wasps fought back through a Josh Lewsey try and Mark van Gisbergen's boot, and they were level at 31-31 with five minutes remaining. But it was the visitors who kept their cool as Andy Goode kicked the Tigers to victory with a penalty and a drop goal. The closing moments saw desperate defence from Leicester as Wasps turned down several penalties to go for the try they needed. Wasps pounded the line and a penalty try looked likely before referee Nigel Williams controversially blew for full-time. Fly-half Goode was the Tigers hero, kicking 22 points in total, while Leicester's overwhelming domination in the scrums ultimately told. Even their lack of discipline in defence - which presented the admirable Van Ginsberg with 26 points - could not undo them as they held out for a famous win. Lawrence Dallaglio's team have now got it all to do in the quest for a quarter-final place given that two of their last three games are away - against Leicester and Biarritz. However, Wasps rugby director Warren Gatland warned his side will will not relinquish their European title without a fight. ""If we lose next week, then we are struggling,"" said Gatland. ""But we don't want to give this trophy away. We worked so hard to win it last season, we will go down fighting. ""We have got to get our scrum right next week, it is the biggest cause for concern."" Leicester coach John Wells saluted the outstanding work of Graham Rowntree and Julian White, who were magnificent up front. ""They were the backbone of our performance today,"" said Wells.

The Tigers dominated the opening 40 minutes but could not turn their territorial advantage into points. That allowed Wasps back into the game and they scored two tries to lead 19-14 at half-time. Neil Back's second-half try gave Leicester hope but Wasps held on for a vital win. The Tigers had won all three of their Pool 2 matches prior to arriving at Adams Park confident that victory would secure a home quarter-final. But they struggled to make their dominance count, with first-half errors and Wasps' resolute defence preventing them from scoring. Despite enjoying more than two-thirds of the possession during the first half, Leicester could only muster one penalty from Neil Back, while they also lost Tom Croft to injury. Wasps, in contrast, scored twice through Danny Cipriani and Josh Lewsey, with Andy Goode adding both conversions. The hosts also saw flanker Joe Worsley sin-binned for a professional foul after just 16 minutes. But even with Wasps down to 14 men, Leicester failed to take advantage, with a series of handling errors - including a knock-on by Martin Corry when he was in the clear - costing them dear. As a result, Wasps took a deserved 14-3 lead into the break after captain Phil Vickery's try had been ruled out for"
sport,Souness Backs Smith For Scotland,"Graeme Souness believes Walter Smith would be the perfect choice to succeed Berti Vogts as Scotland manager. Souness's former assistant at Rangers is hot favourite to take over from Vogts, who resigned on Monday. ""Walter is most definitely the ideal candidate for that job. He'd be perfect for it,"" Souness told BBC Sport. The Scottish Football Association has appointed Tommy Burns as provisional caretaker-boss for the friendly against Sweden on 17 November. ""He fits the bill because of his knowledge and understanding of the Scotland team and football. He is experienced and has been successful."" Souness added: ""Walter is a real football person, as I know from working with him at Ibrox. ""On top of all that he is a proper human being who would command the instant respect of the players and everyone involved in Scottish football."" Souness joined Sir Alex Ferguson in backing Smith's claims. The Scottish Football Association is about to embark on the search for Vogts successor after appointing Tommy Burns in a caretaker capacity. Ferguson said: ""He (Smith) would be the outstanding candidate as far as I'm concerned. ""You need somebody who knows what they're doing and Walter would bring a wealth of experience to the job."" The Man Utd boss continued: ""I don't know what credentials are needed to do the job but it's a job that needs a lot of experience. ""He was my assistant with Scotland and here at Manchester United and he has also managed Glasgow Rangers. ""He would need to change the whole shape of Scottish football and radical changes are needed."" Smith was assistant to Ferguson at the World Cup in Mexico in 1986. The former Everton and Rangers boss has been out of the game since a spell as Manchester United assistant last term. BBC Sport understands that Smith would be willing to discuss taking over if he was approached by the Scottish FA. If he is tempted to take over, it seems almost certain Smith's long-time right-hand man Archie Knox would also play a part in the national team set-up. Smith already has the backing of many pundits and fans, including former Scotland manager Craig Brown. Brown said: ""Walter is an outstanding candidate without doubt. ""He would be admirable choice. I spoke to him on Sunday and I got the impression he would take it. He was asking me about it and I was positive."" Other candidates for the job include former Scotland midfielders Gordon Strachan and Gary McAllister and Vogts' assistant Tommy Burns.","Former Scotland captain Graeme Souness believes George Burley should turn to Alan Smith. The Blackburn striker has not played for his country since the summer of 2004 but Souness thinks Burley should give him another chance. ""I would bring Alan Smith back into the squad,"" Souness told BBC Sport. ""He may not be the greatest player in the world but he is a good professional. ""I think we have got a bit of a dearth of strikers and we need that spark. ""He brings an athleticism and has got a bit of aggression and a dislike for defenders, which is a good thing to have in your team."" Smith's last cap came against Italy in a Euro 2004 qualifier, but Souness thinks the 29-year-old could be useful for Scotland in the forthcoming World Cup qualifiers against Spain and Liechtenstein. ""When he played for me against France, we were three goals up and I took him off because I wanted to win by five,"" recalled Souness, who was manager of Newcastle when Smith joined them from Leeds in 2002. ""He came off and I said 'Alan that was probably your last game for me'. ""He looked at me, said 'righty' and went off to play golf with his dad. ""I then found out he had pulled a hamstring and I thought 'oh no' but he came back in two weeks' time and played the last four games of the season, which were all tough games."
sport,Bridge Could Miss Rest Of Season,"Chelsea left-back Wayne Bridge could miss the rest of the season with a suspected broken ankle. The England international, 24, was hurt in an innocuous challenge with Alan Shearer during the Londoners' FA Cup defeat at Newcastle on Sunday. ""We think it's a big injury,"" said Jose Mourinho, whose Chelsea team this week meet Barcelona in the Champions League and Liverpool in the Carling Cup final. William Gallas and Damien Duff could also miss the Barcelona game. France defender Gallas and Ireland winger Duff both picked up their injuries in the closing stages of Chelsea's 1-0 defeat at St James' Park. With Bridge having gone off after Mourinho used all three substitutes, those knocks plus Carlo Cudicini's red card meant Chelsea finished the game with seven able-bodied players. Cudicini would not have played against Barcelona, but had been promised a game in the Carling Cup final, although he will now miss the Cardiff showpiece through suspension. The manager is not planning to add any new names to his squad ahead of the trip to Barcelona, even though he has few options to replace Bridge at left-back. Celestine Babayaro left the club in January, ironically to join Newcastle, and although Gallas has deputised at left-back before, he is struggling to be fit himself. It could be that Paulo Ferreira, usually a right-back, is switched to left-back with Glen Johnson, who ended the Newcastle game in goal, playing on the right. Youngsters Ben Hudell, Joe Keenan and Sam Tillen would be options should Mourinho decide to call up a replacement, but it is unlikely he would risk an untried prospect in a Champions League tie. Bridge's injury also means Mourinho, who reportedly wants to sign Ashley Cole from Arsenal, will not have a specialist, senior left-back for the run-in to the season. ""He (Bridge) has no chance of playing against Barcelona, probably will not play against Liverpool (in the Carling Cup final) and maybe not for the rest of the season,"" he said. ""The medical department will try to do everything to recover Gallas and Duff. We will have to wait and see, but I won't cry about injuries because we will have 11 players to play on Tuesday."" Shearer said he was unsure what caused Bridge's injury. ""I don't know what happened."" he said. ""It was just a shame. I don't think we even touched each other. ""By all accounts it's pretty serious. I went into the dressing-room after the game and wished him all the best."" Mourinho, whose team are chasing three trophies, has already lost winger Arjen Robben to a serious injury.","Wales centre Jamie Richards could miss the remainder of the season after dislocating his shoulder during Pontypridd's Heineken Cup clash with Glasgow on Saturday. The 22-year-old was injured in a tackle just before half-time in the Pool Four game at Firhill. Richards had started for the Welsh side in place of injured captain Gareth Thomas. ""Jamie Richards could well be out for the rest of the season,"" said Pontypridd coach Richard Webster. ""He's had an MRI scan and it looks as if he has dislocated his shoulder. ""He was very unfortunate in that initial tackle and will be out for four weeks, but we will just have to wait and see how he comes through that."" Richards came on as a replacement for Thomas during Wales' Six Nations defeat by France at the Millennium Stadium earlier this month. And he also started in Wales' 23-15 victory over Scotland at Murrayfield during the opening weekend of the championship. Thomas returned to action last Saturday as Newport Gwent Dragons edged past Saracens 35-33 in their Heineken Cup clash at Watford. The Wales centre scored a try, kicked seven points and impressed in both defence and attack during his return from injury. But Richards' absence could mean a return to the Dragons starting line-up for Thomas. And Webster does not begrudge his captain's return to first-class action after a lengthy spell on the sidelines. ""Gareth is playing very well for us"
sport,Wilkinson To Lead England,"Fly-half Jonny Wilkinson has been named as England's new rugby union captain for the three November Tests. The 25-year-old Newcastle star takes over from Lawrence Dallaglio, who retired from internationals in August. England's acting head coach Andy Robinson said: ""He is a natural leader, holds the respect of the squad and is a formidable talent on the pitch. ""And he consistently demonstrates the energy and commitment I feel is essential to be captain of England."" Robinson added: ""There are several players in the squad I would feel comfortable in calling upon to be England captain but for me Jonny is in every way the right player to take on this challenge. ""Captaincy offers a challenging environment for any player, especially following in the footsteps of Lawrence Dallaglio and before him the World Cup captain, Martin Johnson. ""But I am confident Jonny has what it takes to do an outstanding job as we look ahead towards the next Rugby World Cup in France and I look forward to working with him."" Wilkinson, who has scored 817 points in 52 internationals, kicked the winning drop-goal in the final seconds of extra-time in England's 2003 Rugby World Cup triumph against Australia. But he then missed the entire 2004 Six Nations campaign while recuperating from shoulder surgery, before making his comeback for Newcastle in the Zurich Premiership in August. ""It's the ambition of so many players to one day be captain of England and today I have realised a dream,"" he said. ""I'm honoured Andy wants me to be his captain, and to follow Lawrence and Martin means a lot to me as they are inspirational men who have given so much to England rugby over many years. ""Getting my first England cap against Ireland six years ago was something I'll never forget because to play for your country is very special. Taking on the captaincy is another important step in my career and I do so with immense pride."" Wilkinson made his international debut in the 1998 Six Nations Championship against Ireland when he came off the bench to replace Paul Grayson. He has been a regular in the England starting line-up ever since, played in all three Lions Tests in 2001 and all but one of England's games in the 2003 World Cup. He becomes the 117th captain of England since Fred Stokes held the position in 1871. England's first autumn Test is against Canada on 13 November, followed by the visit of Tri-Nations champions South Africa a week later and then a World Cup re-match with Australia.","Harlequins wing Josh Lewsey and Wasps flanker Richard Hill are among four players omitted as England prepare to face France in the Six Nations opener. Forwards coach Clive Woodward has left out Hill, Lewsey, lock Simon Shaw and full-back Paul Sackey. Instead, former captain Lawrence Dallaglio returns at blind-side flanker. He starts alongside Martin Johnson in the second row and there is a place on the bench for Shaw. In the backs, Mike Catt returns at fly-half after missing the end of last season with a knee injury, with Charlie Hodgson taking over the goal-kicking duties. ""I am delighted that Charlie has recovered from his knee injury and is now back playing club rugby,"" said Woodward. ""I have decided to take Mike Catt as our stand-off because of his experience and his form this season."" In the front row, Neil Martins makes his first Six Nations start for England after an impressive display against South Africa, with Richard Hibbard taking over from Simon Shaw. Ben Kay is preferred to Richard Hill at blind-side flanker, while Lawrence Dallaglio - who retired from international rugby in March last year - returns at number six in place of Lewsey. ""Josh has been playing very well for Quins and is likely to be involved at some stage of this championship,"" said Woodward.

sport,Man Utd Through After Exeter Test,"Manchester United avoided an FA Cup upset by edging past Exeter City in their third round replay. Cristiano Ronaldo scored the opener, slipping the ball between Paul Jones' legs after just nine minutes. United wasted a host of chances to make it safe as Jones made some great saves, but Wayne Rooney put the tie beyond doubt late on with a cool finish. Exeter had chances of their own, Sean Devine twice volleying wide and Andrew Taylor forcing Tim Howard to save. United boss Sir Alex Ferguson was taking few chances after their 0-0 draw in the first game and he handed starts to Paul Scholes and Ryan as well as Ronaldo and Rooney. Exeter began brightly with Devine and Steve Flack seeing plenty of the ball, but it did not take United long to assert their authority and the hosts soon found themselves a goal down. Scholes played a lovely pass in to Ronaldo on the left-hand side of the six-yard box and the Portuguese winger slid the ball between the legs of Jones to open the scoring. United sensed a chance to finish the tie as a contest early on and Ronaldo blazed over before Jones saved well from Scholes and then Rooney. The visitors' pressure by now was incessant and Rooney had another shot blocked while Ronaldo slammed well over the bar again from a good position. Just before the break Giggs had a golden chance to double the advantage, but the Welshman dragged a left-foot effort badly wide from 10 yards. In stoppage time Exeter created their best chance as Alex Jeannin swung in a cross from the left that Devine managed to flick goalwards, but the ball flew wide of Howard's goal. The Grecians came out after the break in determined fashion and Howard had to show safe hands to collect two searching crosses into the United box. Rooney looked like he might have sealed the result with a turn and shot but the ball stuck in the St James Park mud and Jones raced back to gather on the goalline. Moments later Devine had the chance to make himself a hero, but he could only volley Jeannin's brilliant cross wide of Howard's goal after being left unmarked six yards out. After Rooney had completely messed up a free-kick 20 yards out Taylor showed him how it should be done, his stunning drive from distance forcing a flying stop from Howard. The home crowd were baying for a goal and they did get the ball into the net only for Devine's low effort to be ruled out for an obvious offside. The persistent Rooney eventually rounded Jones with three minutes to go and slotted into an empty net to book a home tie with Middlesbrough in the fourth round.

The differences in class were evident in a first half when Exeter looked every inch like a Conference outfit. But United's slick passing and movement gave them a deserved lead when Alan Smith tapped in after Chris Riggott headed Cristiano Ronaldo's cross into his path. Exeter's confidence visibly grew after that and they might have equalised when Lee Makel fired wide after a mix-up between Edwin van der Sar and John O'Shea. And they were made to pay when United doubled their lead after 56 minutes. This time it was Ronaldo who created the goal, producing a piece of magic to slip a pass between two defenders and set up Smith for his second goal of the game. Exeter lost their way as United took control and could have added another goal as Paul Scholes, Ronaldo and Alan Smith all missed good chances.

sport,Ireland 17-12 South Africa,"Ronan O'Gara scored all Ireland's points as the home side claimed only their second ever win over South Africa on an emotional day at Lansdowne Road. O'Gara's first-half try, poached after a quick tap-penalty, helped the Irish to a 8-3 lead at half-time. Three further O'Gara penalties extended Ireland's lead to 17-6 as the game entered the final quarter. Two Percy Montgomery penalties set up a frantic finish but Ireland held out to claim a famous victory. Ireland began strongly and were never led, but the match was tense and closely fought throughout. Aware of the threat posed by the South Africans, Ireland pressed hard from the outset, and played some impressive rugby while searching for a breakthrough. Early on, Denis Hickie thought he was in for a try after a delightful backline move but Shane Horgan's pass was adjudged to have gone forward by referee Paul Honiss. Ireland continued to press and they showed their intent by opting for a line-out in the 19th minute when three straight-forward points were on offer. Another South African infringement a minute later led to Ireland's first points - O'Gara took a quick tap-penalty and charged over the opposition line for an Irish try. The Springboks could feel hard done by as captain John Smit had his back to the play when O'Gara pounced after referee Honiss had told the skipper to warn his own players after consistent infringements. Stung by the score, the South Africans almost replied with a try of their own within 60 seconds with Geordan Murphy's ankle-tap tackle denying a certain try for Percy Montgomery. However, the Springboks did win a penalty a minute later which Montgomery easily slotted to cut Ireland's lead to 5-3. Ireland got out of jail when the South Africans had a three-to-one overlap near the Irish line only to waste the chance. After the sustained Springboks pressure, the Irish produced an attack of their own in the 34th minute which culminated with O'Gara's clever drop-goal to restore his side's lead to five points which remained the margin at half-time. Sustained Irish pressure immediately after half-time was rewarded by another O'Gara penalty. However, Montgomery responded quickly by slotting over a superb penalty from near the right touchline to cut Ireland's lead to five points again. Montgomery then burst through the Irish defence in the 48th minute and it took a superb Girvan Dempsey tackle to prevent a try. The South Africans suffered a double-blow in the 52nd minute when Schalk Burger was sin-binned for the second week in a row after killing the ball and O'Gara punished the transgression by notching another penalty. In the 61st minute, Hickie was left frustrated by a poor pass from Girvan Dempsey as a chance to seal the match was wasted. However, a late tackle on Brian O'Driscoll enabled O'Gara to notch another penalty in the 63rd minute which extended Ireland's lead to 17-6. However, two Montgomery penalties had Ireland's lead in peril again as the Springboks closed to within five points with seven minutes remaining. South Africa produced a huge effort in the closing minutes but Ireland held on to claim a deserved victory.

The hosts led 12-3 at the break thanks to an Andrew Trimble try and five points from Ronan O'Gara. But South Africa hit back after the break through two penalties from Bryan Habana. Ireland's defence was outstanding, however, and the visitors could not breach their line. The result is a huge boost for Ireland as they prepare to face England in the opening round of the 2008 Six Nations Championship. The hosts dominated the opening quarter but failed to make their territorial advantage count as they were repeatedly thwarted by dogged Springbok defence. As in their previous two Tests, South Africa took time to get going but they finally showed some sign of life when they moved into Irish territory. But the Irish defence held firm despite sustained pressure, although they were briefly ruffled when Johan Goosen kicked into touch on the full. A scrappy period of play ensued with neither side able to gain any control as handling errors and poor presentation spoiled any real rhythm. Ireland finally opened their opponents up with a clever chip and chase move down the right, but the final pass to Denis Hickie was wayward. South Africa were dealt a blow when captain John Smit limped off to be replaced by Victor Matfield, and Ireland took advantage of their extra man as Gordon D'Arcy launched a audacious counter-attack from inside his own 22.

sport,Time To Get Tough On Friendlies?,"For an international manager, a friendly provides an important opportunity to work with your players. The only problem is that the game itself can often be a farce. Some people have been saying it would be better to get the players together for the week, and do away with the 90 minutes at the end. I would say it's 50-50 whether you should have these games or not, and if you look at it that way you would probably say you're better not doing so. It would certainly keep club managers happy, as it would reduce the risk of players returning to domestic duty injured. But international bosses will tell you that scrapping friendlies is counterproductive because the only way for a team to get better is by playing. The more you play together, the easier it is when it comes to the crunch in games like World Cup quarter-finals against Brazil. Often in friendlies, though, a manager will play his strongest side for the first 45 minutes and then send out an entirely different one in the second half. And it's very difficult for any player to come on as substitute in a side with a few changes, let alone a whole team's worth. The debate will rage on, and I'm not sure there is a satisfactory solution. One manager who has got it right this week is Walter Smith. The new Scotland manager has decided to have a training camp instead of a friendly for his first international week since replacing Berti Vogts. It is the sort of move you would expect from Walter, who is a canny manager. The players have had such a hard time recently that he is better off getting them together in a relaxed atmosphere and trying to generate some team spirit before the next World Cup qualifiers. If he had sent them out on Wednesday and they had been badly beaten, it would have done them no good whatsoever. John Toshack has his first game in charge of Wales, and it will be important for him to get a decent result against Hungary. He will have his own ideas on individuals and how to play and will probably look more at the performance, but the public wants results. It's extremely difficult to get the balance for friendlies. If you win, people forget them, but if you lose it becomes a stat that can be used against you. England's game against Holland is a good example. It looks like a good opportunity to try out players like Middlesbrough winger Stewart Downing or Crystal Palace striker Andy Johnson. But you have got to remember Sven-Goran Eriksson's side were given a lesson by Spain in the last game they played. The injury problems in defence should at least give the likes of Wes Brown and Jamie Carragher a chance to impress. For the club managers, it will simply be a case of waiting at home with fingers crossed.","The international friendly is a great idea in principle. It allows fans to see their heroes play in the flesh without the pressure of a competitive game. But in practice, the friendly has become a vehicle for some of football's dodgiest deals. And it is time for Fifa to show its mettle and clean up the game's oldest scam. The unfriendly truth is that the vast majority of international friendlies are no such thing. They are competitive matches masquerading as non-competitive games. The only discernible difference between them and competitive matches is the absence of prize money and points. And we all know how seriously Fifa takes that distinction. The typical friendly these days is not a relaxed get-together between old pals but an exercise in fast buck-grabbing, none more so than those involving smaller nations. It is all about the cash, and nowhere more so than in the bloated budgets of African teams, where five-star hotels, charter flights and per diems are the norm rather than the exception, and where there are usually enough officials and hangers-on to fill out a jumbo jet. At least a third of these so-called friendlies are not even played but simply negotiated, with no intention of ever taking place. And it is not only African nations who are involved in this kind of politically expedient hypocrisy. Both Scotland and Northern Ireland have been quick to cash in on an appetite for ""historic"" matches against countries they have not met for decades. Scotland"
sport,Hewitt Fights Back To Reach Final,"Lleyton Hewitt kept his dream of an Australian Open title alive with a four-set win over Andy Roddick in Friday's second semi-final. The home favourite will face Marat Safin in Sunday's final after coming through 3-6 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (7-4) 6-1. Hewitt fought back from a set down and trailed in both tie-breaks but would not be denied, thrilling the Melbourne crowd with a typically battling effort. He is aiming to be the first Australian winner since Mark Edmondson in 1976. Hewitt is the first Australian to make the final since Pat Cash lost to Mats Wilander in 1988, but faces a huge challenge against Safin - the conqueror of Roger Federer. After needing five sets in his last two matches there was reason to think Hewitt might struggle for fitness. He certainly made a sluggish start, dropping his opening service game, and Roddick dominated with his huge serve as he took the first set. After 12 tense games in the second, the key moment came when Hewitt raised his game in the tie-break to overturn an early mini-break. That energised the crowd but Roddick was not finished and raced 4-1 clear in the crucial third before Hewitt pegged him back and forced another tie-break. Again Roddick broke first and again Hewitt fought back, taking the lead with a superb backhand pass. The Australian was not to be denied and a disheartened Roddick made little impact in the fourth set as Hewitt raced to victory, sending the Melbourne crowd wild and ensuring the final will be a huge occasion. ""It's awesome,"" said Hewitt. ""I started preparing for this tournament nine months ago. ""I've done a lot of hard yards to get here. ""I've always said I'd do anything to get in the first night final at the Australian Open. Now I've got my chance."" Roddick was furious with himself for failing to take advantage of leads in both tie-breaks. ""I'm usually pretty money in those,"" said Roddick. ""Either one of those would have given me a distinct advantage. ""I'm mad, I felt I was in there with a shot. He put himself in position to win big points. I donated a little more than I would have wanted."" And the American played down the influence of one spectator who appeared to contribute to a double fault by shouting during Rodick's service action. ""It just took one jackass to shout out,"" said Roddick, adding that the crowd overall was ""very respectful"".","Tim Henman's conqueror Vince Spadea has been sensationally dumped out of the NASDAQ-100 Open in Miami, despite leading James Blake 3-0 in the semi-final. Spadea's hopes of reaching his first ATP Tour final disappeared as he lost the fourth set 6-1 to concede a place in Sunday's title decider to Blake. Spadea had stunned world number five Blake in their quarter-final but the American fought back to beat the unseeded New Yorker 3-6 6-1 6-4. ""I feel really good right now,"" said second seed Blake. ""I feel like I've got a great chance to win."" Defending champion Andre Agassi also progressed to the final four with a 7-5 6-2 win over Alejandro Falla. The 20th seed will face either Tim Henman or Marat Safin, with the Briton leading 4-3 ahead of their semi-final on Thursday. And if the Russian does make it through, he will play his first ATP Tour semi-final. Spadea had beaten two seeded players to reach his first semi-final on the senior tour but found himself two breaks down in the opening game against Blake. The American then had two match points on his own serve at 5-4 but lost it as Blake finished off the set with a backhand winner. Undeterred, Blake broke in the opening game of set four and then again to go 4-0 up"
sport,Juninho Demand For O'Neill Talks,"Juninho's agent has confirmed that the player is hoping for talks with Martin O'Neill as the Brazilian midfielder comes closer to departing Celtic. Brian Hassell says no official approach has been received from Manchester City but that the English club had been earmarked as a possible destination. But it was being stressed to BBC Sport that Juninho would prefer to remain with the Scottish champions. Juninho wants assurances that he will return to O'Neill's first-team plans. He has become frustrated with his lack of first-team action since his move from Middlesbrough in the summer. Hassel says Juninho, who has just bought a new home, would ""desperately like to stay at Celtic"" but will seek a move if it is made clear that he is not wanted. The agent also stressed that nothing should be read into the 30-year-old's father being in Scotland and talk of a move back to Botafogo in Brazil. Juninho's father was simply in the country to see his son and grandchildren. ""I know there is interest from a Brazilian club, but I know Juninho doesn't want to go there,"" said Hassel. ""He wants to stay in Britain. In fact, he wants to stay at Celtic."" Hassall made it clear that a move to Manchester City, who are badly in need of a midfield play-maker, was more of a possibility than Botafogo, or Mexican outfit Red Sharks Veracruz, who also expressed an interest. ""It was a thought at one stage,"" he said. ""If you are not going to get a game under one manager, you look for another whose style of play suits you. ""He is a fan of Kevin Keegan's style of play. It would not be a bad move for him."" Juninho had earlier told the Daily Record: ""The manager has had a lot of chances to put me in his team but it hasn't happened. ""If that is the case then this is the opportunity for me to go. That would be good for the club and good for me. ""If I have no part in his plans, there is no point in remaining here waiting for a chance that never comes."" The attacking midfielder also claims he has not had the backing of boss Martin O'Neill since his move to Celtic Park. ""I can't understand why I am in this situation,"" he continued. ""When a manager brings a new player to the club, he gives that player support.""","Ex-Coventry boss Gordon Strachan has called on Fifa to mediate in the row between Middlesbrough and Brazilian star Juninho. The 24-year-old has been left out of Boro's last three games despite saying he wants to stay at the Riverside Stadium, with boss Steve McClaren threatening to fine him if he plays. ""If you leave it to lawyers, you'll never get anything sorted out,"" said Strachan. ""It has to be through Fifa or something because there's too much at stake."" Juninho has been linked with a host of top European sides including Arsenal, Chelsea and Real Madrid after saying he wants to quit Boro. But McClaren has insisted he will not let him go on the cheap and fined him two weeks' wages for breaking a club discipline code. He has since reinstated the player into the first team - but not before he had left him out of home games against Manchester United and Liverpool, citing the need for ""team spirit"" in the absence of injured strike duo Craig Bellamy and Andrew Johnson. And he warned: ""If he wishes to be part of the team, there are certain things we expect from a professional footballer. If he doesn't abide by those rules, he will be fined."" But Strachan, who took over as Bulgaria coach last week, added on BBC Radio Five Live: ""If you listen to what Steve McClaren is saying, you have to ask 'what is going on' because you"
sport,Giggs Handed Wales Leading Role,"Ryan Giggs will captain Wales as he wins his 50th cap in Wednesday's friendly against Hungary in Cardiff. John Toshack, in his first game as coach after succeeding Mark Hughes, admits he is surprised that Giggs has only just reached the landmark. ""With the games he's played for United, proportionately it doesn't seem that many for Wales,"" Toshack said. ""But he's one of the greatest of all Welsh internationals and on his 50th cap it's appropriate he's captain."" Giggs admits he had briefly considered retirement from the international game, but is now targetting playing for Wales in the 2008 European Championships. The Manchester United wing revealed how club manager Sir Alex Ferguson talked him into extending his Wales career. ""I briefly discussed my international future with Sir Alex, but he urged me to carry on,"" Giggs said. ""He feels, like myself, that I have no weight problems and keep myself fit, so in three or four years' time I will be able to play in the European finals if we get there. ""The manager has always wanted me to play for my club and country and he was keen for me to continue because I am fit enough."" Giggs admits he was wavering and considering joining the likes of former Wales skipper Gary Speed and United team-mate Paul Scholes in committing the remaining years of his career to club football. But Giggs is now focussed on making the Toshack era even more successful than the time Hughes spent at the helm. The Manchester United winger won his first cap as a 17-year-old in 1991, an away loss to Germany, and now faces his landmark appearance at the age of 31. With Giggs leading Wales out against Hungary, there is every chance that he will become the permanent successor to Speed. However, Toshack refused to reveal whether he sees Giggs as a long-term option. ""For this particular game I think it is appropriate that Ryan Giggs will be captain, it's his 50th cap and he's known for some time about that,"" Toshack said. On Wednesday night Toshack takes charge of his first match since replacing Hughes, and Giggs said: ""It's my 50th cap and I am looking forward to it, and I hope to play a lot more times from here on in. ""It's important to be here, all the players feel the same. It's a new start and all the top players certainly see it as important. ""I see myself leading by example, it is something I have taken on for Wales as well as United these past few seasons. ""The way John is looking at things, he is aiming to build his side around the experienced lads right up to the next tournament, the Euro 2006 event. ""I have told John I will be around for the next European tournament, by then I will be 35 so hopefully I will still be okay. ""A lot can happen, but I'm hoping to be around."" Giggs' own personal future at Old Trafford is still up in the air as he has yet to reach agreement on a new contract, with Manchester United offering one extra year and Giggs seeking two. ""I have put the contract thing to the back of my mind at the moment,"" said Giggs. ""It is an important period for the club and I am just concentrated on that. ""I've heard the suggestions, hopefully there is a two-year deal about to be offered because that is what I am looking for, to get it sorted out. ""I'm enjoying my football, the way United have been playing and my own form, you have to enjoy it. ""We have massive games coming up: Manchester City this week, then the Everton cup tie, followed by AC Milan in the Champions League, and my first Wales game under John Toshack, so it's an important time.""","Ryan Giggs has been appointed as a senior member of the Wales management team for their 2005 World Cup qualifiers. The 32-year-old Manchester United winger has been invited to attend all future training sessions, team meetings and games. ""It's a great honour,"" said Giggs. ""I've grown up supporting Wales and to be involved in the set-up is something I'm really looking forward to."" Giggs has scored 11 times in 77 appearances for his country. He was previously involved in helping coach Mark Hughes prepare for games. ""He's a great ambassador for Welsh football,"" said Hughes. ""And as a player he still has the ability to affect a game and make a difference."" Giggs' appointment means he will be eligible to play for Wales at next year's World Cup if he is named in the final squad. Since making his international debut against the Republic of Ireland in 1991, Giggs has appeared in three World Cups and two European Championships. A statement on the Football Association of Wales website said: ""Ryan has agreed to attend all sessions and team meetings and, if selected, to future international matches. ""This is a unique situation where Ryan will be representing Manchester United and Wales in the same season."" Giggs is one of several players being invited to help the Wales management team prepare for their vital matches against Slovakia, Russia, Macedonia, Northern Ireland and Finland. ""Ryan will be present at all our meetings and training sessions, which will be a huge help in terms of"
sport,Umaga Ready For Lions,"All Blacks captain Tama Umaga has warned the British and Irish Lions will be his most fearsome opponents yet ahead of their summer tour. But Umaga, in England for Saturday's IRB Rugby Aid match, also backed New Zealand to win the three-Test series against the Lions. He told BBC Sport: ""It's potentially the most fearsome line-up I've ever come up against. They're awesome. ""But I'd back us all the way to beat them when they come over."" Lions boss Sir Clive Woodward is set to announce his squad for the June-July tour next month. When Woodward was appointed last year, it was widely believed he would rely heavily on his former England players. But Umaga said: ""He'd be hard pushed to do that now considering the shape of the Six Nations. ""Don't get me wrong, England have got a lot of talented guys and I'm sure there are some of them who'll make the Lions Test XV. ""But you can't disguise Wales and Ireland in particular. Some of the tries they've scored have been great. I'll admit it'll be fairly awesome lining up against the likes of Brian O'Driscoll."" Umaga will meet O'Driscoll in Saturday's Rugby Aid match at Twickenham, with the Irish captain leading the Northern Hemisphere side. O'Driscoll is among a host of players in the Northern Hemisphere squad, coached by Woodward, that are tipped for Lions call-ups. ""It'll be good for us to get an early idea of some of these guys, although a lot can change between now and June,"" Umaga said. The 31-year-old admitted interest in the Lions tour was immense, calling it ""the biggest thing to hit New Zealand since Lord of the Rings"". He added: ""As players, it's enough for us to be driven by the rarity of playing the Lions. In fact, it's not just us All Blacks - it's the talk of the country."" Umaga admitted the fear of injury weighed on his mind ahead of Saturday's charity game, which features a host of big names including George Gregan, Andrew Mehrtens and Chris Latham. But he admitted the value of the cause - proceeds of the match will go to aiding victims of the tsunami - easily won him over. ""The second [Southern Hemisphere coach] Rod Macqueen made the approach, I didn't hesitate. It was great when New Zealand Rugby then gave me the all clear. ""Thankfully I didn't know anyone that was involved in the tragedy of the tsunami but you couldn't miss all the horrific reports on the news. ""There are so many people that were affected, are still affected and will be affected for a long time. It's just good to know we can do something minor to help out."" - The match will be televised on BBC One at 1400 GMT on Saturday.","Tana Umaga has warned the British and Irish Lions that the All Blacks are primed for a fight in Saturday's third Test. The New Zealand fly-half has revealed that some of his team-mates were close to ""packing it in"" after defeat in the second Test. ""Some guys were questioning themselves, but we had a good team talk and it's all turned around,"" said Umaga. ""We've got to get back to basics and go out and front up physically."" Umaga was among those who struggled to make an impact in the second Test, but he believes the third clash will be different. Lions prop Adam Jones suggested the All Blacks were ""flat"" in Wellington, but Umaga is convinced they came up against a side determined to stifle them. He added: ""They came out there with a game plan and you've got to give them credit for that. But physically they were not up to the mark and we took that as a challenge. ""I think it's been good for our group to have had to dig deep, come back from 14-0 down and put ourselves back in contention for this game. ""The whole atmosphere has changed around the place and everyone has come together."" The Lions' pack dominated the second Test, dominating the scrum and winning most of the line-outs. But Umaga is convinced the tide will turn on Saturday and has warned his team-mates not to get drawn into a brawl. ""You can't go into a"
sport,Federer Joins All-Time Greats,"The last year has seen one player dominate men's tennis, and one country dominate the women's game. Roger Federer became the first man since Mats Wilander in 1988 to win three Grand Slams in one season. And after Anastasia Myskina became the first Russian woman to win a Grand Slam at the French Open, two more followed at Wimbledon and the US Open. Meanwhile, Briton Tim Henman enjoyed his best year, while Greg Rusedski fought back superbly from adversity. Federer began the year as world number one and holder of the Wimbledon and Masters Cup titles, and set about conquering new ground. The Swiss sounded warning of the dominance to come at the Australian Open. He ripped through the draw before beating Marat Safin in the final. Andy Roddick was the only player to put up any real resistance at Wimbledon, and Federer's performance against Lleyton Hewitt in the US Open final was breathtaking. Federer again got the better of Hewitt in the season-ending Masters Cup. His victory in Houston proved to be his 13th successive win in a final, an Open era record. The only major let-down was a third-round loss to Gustavo Kuerten at the French Open, and Roland Garros will be his main target in 2005. There was also a surprise loss to the unheralded Tomas Berdych at the Olympic Games, which saw Chile dominate as Nicoals Massu took the singles and then paired up with Fernando Gonzaelz to win doubles gold. Another major trophy that looks beyond Federer is the Davis Cup, which was won by Spain in a 3-2 home success over the USA in Seville. Roddick struggled on the clay, losing to Rafael Nadal on the opening day before going down to Carlos Moya in the all-important fourth rubber. Henman broke new ground by reaching the semis on clay at the French Open - a stunning effort - and also at the US Open. A quarter-final defeat to Mario Ancic at Wimbledon was disappointing for the limp manner of the Briton's defeat, but he remains optimistic of going further next year. British number two Rusedski endured a rollercoaster year, returning to the circuit after being cleared of a doping offence in March. With his ranking down at 168, many feared the 31-year-old's career was over, but he battled back in the second half of the season to re-enter the top 50. The Russian women finally delivered on their long-recognised promise in 2004, with Myskina, Maria Sharapova and Svetlana Kuznetsova winning Grand Slams, before taking the season-ending Fed Cup. But while the young Russians were on the way up, it was a different story for the Belgians and the Williams sisters. Only veteran Lindsay Davenport held the new wave at bay, a stunning run of form after Wimbledon taking her to number one ahead of Amelie Mauresmo, whose Grand Slam drought goes on. The year started in regulation fashion as Justine Henin-Hardenne beat compatriot Kim Clijsters at the Australian Open. A virus ruined the rest of Henin-Hardenne's year, although she was fit enough to win Olympic gold, but Clijsters had an even more miserable 2004. She suffered a serious wrist injury and then announced the end of her relationship with Lleyton Hewitt, and will be happy to see the year end. In their absence, Myskina thrashed Elena Dementieva in a historic, but woeful, all-Russian final at the French Open. Wimbledon was a more refreshing affair as Sharapova captivated SW19, showing nerves of steel as she battled past Davenport and Serena Williams to take the title. Davenport was a strong favourite for the US Open but, hampered by injury, lost to the powerful and unflappable Kuznetsova in the semis. Kuznetsova went on to give Dementieva another Grand Slam final thrashing, with the latter's wayward serve becoming one of the talking points of the year. With the Russians still improving, the likes of Henin-Hardenne, Clijsters, Davenport, Mauresmo, Venus and Serena will need to be fully fit and motivated in 2005. And it may take their compatriot Safin to challenge Federer on the men's side.","Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer reached the last four at the Masters Cup with straight-set victories on Friday. Nadal, who beat Andy Roddick in the previous round, beat Lleyton Hewitt 6-2 6-2 to add to his Australian Open triumph this year. World number one Federer was equally impressive as he beat Marat Safin 6-2 6-3 to win their head-to-head clash for the seventh time in succession. ""I'm happy I won that battle,"" said Swiss ace Federer. ""I thought he played some great shots out there."" The world number two has now won seven tournaments in a row and will face either Roddick or Andre Agassi in Saturday's last four. ""It definitely feels great to win seven tournaments in a row,"" added Federer. ""It was a very important match for me today against Safin. It was just one step away from the semis and I had to be very focused from the first point."" Roddick will face Agassi in Saturday's first semi-final after the American beat Ivan Ljubicic 6-4 7-6 (7-4). In the women's draw, world number one Lindsay Davenport beat Russian Elena Dementieva 6-1 7-5 to set up a semi-final against Serena Williams.

sport,Chelsea Clinch Cup In Extra-Time,"(after extra-time - score at 90 mins 1-1) John Arne Riise volleyed Liverpool ahead after 45 seconds but Steven Gerrard scored a 79th-minute own goal. Blues boss Jose Mourinho was sent off for taunting Liverpool fans after the goal and he watched on television as his side went on to win the game. Drogba and Kezman scored from close range before Antonio Nunez's header made for a tense finale. It was an amazing climax which gave Mourinho his first silverware as Chelsea manager. Yet it was controversial too, after Mourinho's sending off, apparently for putting his finger to his lips to hush the Liverpool fans. There was no hushing them after the extraordinary opening in which the Reds took a stunning lead inside the first minute. Riise could not have connected any better with Morientes' cross as he smashed a left-foot volley past Petr Cech. The goal, the quickest-ever in a League Cup final, stunned a Blues side whose previously rock-solid confidence had been shaken by consecutive losses to Newcastle and Barcelona in the previous week. The Blues' attacking chances were limited, and Jerzy Dudek was equal to Frank Lampard's powerfully-struck drive and Drogba's low shot. Despite their frustration, Chelsea began to dominate midfield without seriously threatening to break Liverpool's well-organised defence. Joe Cole had a shot blocked and a promising Damien Duff break was halted by a good tackle from Djimi Traore, but the Reds reached half-time without any major scares. The Blues began the second half with more urgency and pegged Liverpool back. Nevertheless, Liverpool were living dangerously and they needed a fantastic double save from Dudek on 54 minutes, first at full stretch from Gudjohnsen's header, then to smother William Gallas' follow-up. And despite Chelsea's possession, it was Liverpool who fashioned the next clear opportunity as Luis Garcia fed Dietmar Hamann whose shot forced a superb save from Cech. And the Blues' increasingly adventurous approach saw Liverpool earn another chance on the break on 75 minutes as Paulo Ferreira denied Gerrard with a last-ditch tackle. But Gerrard was on the scoresheet minutes later - in the most unfortunate fashion - as he inadvertently deflected Ferrerira's free-kick past his own keeper and in off the post to bring Chelsea level. That prompted Mourinho's reaction which saw him sent off, but Chelsea still pressed and Duff had a chance to win the game with seven minutes remaining. Dudek saved bravely at the Irishman's feet, while Milan Baros shot wildly at the other end to ensure extra time. Drogba almost headed Chelsea in front two minutes into extra-time but the striker saw the ball rebound off the post. But seconds after the half-time interval, Drogba made no mistake, picking the ball up from Glen Johnson's long throw inside the six-yard box and sidefooting home. And Kezman appeared to have made the game safe as he netted from close range after Gudjohnsen's cross in the 110th minute. There was still drama as Nunez beat Cech to a high ball with six minutes remaining to head his side level, but despite Liverpool's desperate attacks, Chelsea clung on to win.

Jamie Carragher put Liverpool ahead with a header after nine minutes but Chelsea levelled when Didier Drogba flicked in a John Terry header after 55 minutes. Jerzy Dudek saved from Claude Makele after 74 minutes before Steven Gerrard hit the bar for Liverpool in extra time. Chelsea, who have now won the Carling Cup four times, had to play for more than an hour with 10 men after captain John Terry was sent off for a foul on Florent Sinama-Pongolle. But they held on for their second trophy of the season, their first piece of silverware since clinching the FA Cup in 2000. And boss Mourinho said: ""It is fantastic. I am so happy for my players, my staff and especially for the club and our fans. ""It is important for us to win a trophy, especially when we have been out of all competitions for so long. ""I'm very happy that we have won a second trophy, but this is just the first step towards bigger things."" Mourinho revealed he was not too worried about Terry's red card, which came after a collision with Liverpool striker Sinama-Pongolle. ""I think he deserved it, but what is important is that he is not injured,"" Mourinho said. ""If he had broken a leg I would be very sad, but he is not injured."" He also paid"
sport,Wenger Keeping Faith With Almunia,"Arsene Wenger has pledged to keep faith with stand-in keeper Manuel Almunia for the crunch week which could define Arsenal's season. Almunia will start Tuesday's Champions League group tie against Rosenborg and is likely to face Chelsea on Sunday. Wenger said: ""You don't think I would take out one goalkeeper for just one game, do you? I don't do that. ""I have to give him a run for a few games. It's just that I don't want to make this story bigger than it is."" Wenger insists he has complete faith in the 27-year-old Spaniard, who was signed last summer from Celta Vigo as back-up to Jens Lehmann. ""If you look at my career, you will see that I have left many big players out for a long time. I've done it with Dennis Bergkamp, Kanu, everybody. ""It's because it's a goalkeeper, that's all. It's a usual situation for me. You put your best team out, no matter who it is. ""For me, it was not a big mistake at Old Trafford and I wasn't alarmed by what happened against Birmingham either. ""It's nothing against Lehmann. I think he's a great keeper, as is Almunia. You can only play one of them. ""These people are not robots - they have good periods and less good periods. Just because Lehmann doesn't play for two or three weeks, or longer or shorter, it doesn't mean I've lost faith in him."" But former Arsenal keeper David Seaman believes Lehmann has been harshly treated. Seaman told the Daily Mail: ""Jens is a fantastic keeper. He deserves another chance. ""He has made a few mistakes but on form he deserves to be the first-team choice."" With Arsenal hit by injuries and suspension, inexperienced midfield pair of Mathieu Flamini and Cesc Fabregas will line up against Rosenborg but Wenger is confident they will prove more than capable. ""It puts a lot of pressure on them but it's a good learning process,"" said Wenger. ""I'm not worried as they are both mentally strong and will put in the needed workrate."" The Gunners go into the game boosted by the news that defender Sol Campbell is on the verge of signing a new deal with the club. And the 30-year-old, whose current contract runs out in the summer, has made it clear he is determined to achieve Champions League success with Arsenal. Campbell said: ""It means a lot to me to go through, it's everything. We want to carry on in this competition. ""That's where the best teams in Europe are. To be in there, playing against these guys and trying to win the trophy, is the first thing in my mind."" Meanwhile, Thierry Henry believes he will be blamed if Arsenal fail to qualify for the next stage of the Champions League. Henry will captain the side in place of the suspended Patrick Vieira as the Gunners seek the required victory over Rosenborg. And the striker said: ""If we don't win and we go out of the competition, like it or not, it's going to be my fault. That's the way it is. ""If the team don't win I know I will be criticised, no matter how I play.""","Arsene Wenger has revealed that Manuel Almunia will start in goal for Arsenal at Fulham on Saturday. The Spanish keeper has been in fine form since displacing Jens Lehmann but was dropped for the Champions League win over Olympiakos. But the Arsenal manager said: ""He will play against Fulham. He has been solid in the last three games without being outstanding."" Winger Jose Antonio Reyes is unlikely to return to the side after a lacklustre display against the Greeks. ""He played a bad game but I decided to keep him on because of his influence on the other players,"" said Wenger. ""I think he can be a very important player for us. It is important that you keep your big players."" Meanwhile, Arsenal are hoping midfielder Patrick Vieira will be available at Craven Cottage after recovering from a back injury. The France international has not played since the 2-1 defeat by Chelsea on 22 November."
sport,Liverpool Pledge To Keep Gerrard,"Liverpool chief executive Rick Parry insists the club will never sell Steven Gerrard amid reports Chelsea will renew their bid to lure him from Anfield. Gerrard reiterated his desire to win trophies with the Reds after his superb Champions League winner on Wednesday. And Parry has moved to scotch claims that Chelsea could launch a £35m bid. ""There is no chance of Stevie going in January,"" said Parry. ""That just won't happen. Our intention is that we will never let him go."" Gerrard scored a spectacular late goal to give Liverpool a 3-1 win over Olympiakos and book their place in the knockout stages. ""Of course he is ambitious but so are we,"" Parry added. ""We firmly believe that if we can satisfy his ambition he will remain a Liverpool player. ""We have an open and straightforward relationship. We both know where we stand and that played a big part in his decision to stay last summer. If he was not so committed to Liverpool he would have gone by now."" Gerrard had said before Wednesday's game he would consider leaving if the club was knocked out of Europe, with Real Madrid also believed to be monitoring his situation. ""The main point I have made is I want to be in a Liverpool side which challenges for the Champions League and the title all the time,"" he said afterwards. ""I want to be winning things with Liverpool, not somewhere else. ""I am a fan as well and I think what I have said the supporters will agree with. ""We have to build on wins like that, not just settle for a great win and then not progress any further. ""My goal was one of the most important I have ever scored and I hope it turns out to be one of the most important for the club for a long time. ""I know I put a lot of pressure on myself because of what I said, and I felt I needed a big performance, but I am not going to go around telling lies about how I feel."" Reds manager Rafael Benitez believes Gerrard can win everything he wants to without moving clubs. ""Steven can win all he wants with us and we need him. He has seen that we have a good team and we can do more things in the future,"" said Benitez. ""But if we want to win more games, important games, we need Steven in the team. ""We need his strength, the strong mentality he has and his quality. I think he likes and wants the responsibility of leading this team.""","Liverpool have told Chelsea they will not budge from their £32m valuation of captain Steven Gerrard. Chelsea have had a bid of £28m turned down but are expected to return with an improved offer. Liverpool have also rejected a £26m offer from Real Madrid for striker Florent Sinama Pongolle. And the Anfield club have warned the French forward he will be sold if he does not accept a new contract. ""We will keep him if we can,"" said chief executive Rick Parry. ""We made that clear to Real Madrid and we made it clear to Chelsea and we will make it clear to any other club who may be interested."" Chelsea were reported to have made their approach for 26-year-old Gerrard after seeing a bid for his Stamford Bridge team-mate Frank Lampard turned down last week. But, having already lost defender John Arne Riise to Roma and midfielder Danny Murphy to Tottenham, Parry maintained Liverpool would stand by their valuation of the England midfielder. ""They know where we stand,"" Parry told BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek programme. ""They know what our valuation is and we are not going to change that."" Asked whether Gerrard would also have to agree to new terms, Parry added: ""It's a combination of both things - you can't sell them on the cheap and you can't force them to stay either. ""I think it's very important that we keep our best players and the fact that Steven Gerrard is one of"
sport,Britain Boosted By Holmes Double,"Athletics fans endured a year of mixed emotions in 2004 as stunning victories went hand-in-hand with disappointing defeats and more drugs scandals. Kelly Holmes finally fulfilled her potential by storming to double gold on the track at the Olympic Games. Holmes helped erase the gloom hanging over Team GB after their biggest medal hope, Paula Radcliffe, dropped out of the marathon and then the 10,000m. Britain's men's 4x100m relay team also did their bit by taking a shock gold. Holmes had started the year in disappointing style, falling over in the final of 1500m at the World Indoor Championships where she was favourite. Her Olympic build-up was clouded by self doubt but that proved unfounded as she overhauled rival Maria Mutola to win the 800m - her first global title. Just five days later, the 34-year-old made it double gold in the 1500m. It was the first time in 84 years a Briton has achieved the Olympic middle-distance double. While Holmes left Athens as the star of Team GB, it was Radcliffe who carried expectations before the August Games. The 30-year-old marathon world record holder went into the Athens event as favourite but an exhausted Radcliffe dropped out after 23 miles in tears. Her decision to enter the 10,000m five days later also backfired as she again pulled out with eight laps remaining. But Radcliffe helped put her Olympic trauma behind her with a thrilling win in November's New York Marathon. The 4x100m team grabbed some last-gasp glory for the British men's Olympic squad after a poor start to the Games. It seemed as though Athens would be the first Games where the men would fail to win a medal with Michael East the only individual track finalist in the 1500m. But Darren Campell, Jason Gardener, Marlon Devonish and Mark Lewis-Francis made amends in the sprint relay. The quartet held off favourites the USA to win Britain's first relay medal since 1912 in 38.07 seconds. Gardener added the Olympic relay crown to his World Indoor title over 60m and, just like Holmes, finally lived up to his promise in 2004. Kelly Sotherton completed Team GB's athletics medal haul in Athens with a surprise bronze in the heptathlon. The 28-year-old won her first championship medal since becoming a full-time athlete in 2003. But it was a different story for Britain's defending champion Denise Lewis, who withdrew on day two of the competition after some poor results. Lewis, who was troubled by injury, has ruled out retiring while Sotherton is tipped to build on her success. The Athens Olympics proved to be a landmark occasion for Steve Backley, who retired from competition after finishing fourth in the javelin. The battling 35-year-old leaves the sport with a vast medal haul including two silvers and one Olympic bronze. And Backley's departure was balanced by the return of injury-hit decathlete Dean Macey, who came fourth in Athens. The continued improvement of sprinter Abi Oyepitan and long jumper Chris Tomlinson also boosted Team GB. Sadly, the 2004 Olympics did not escape the problems of drugs misuse. On the eve of the Games, Greek sprinters Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou missed a drugs test and claimed to have been involved in a road crash. Kenteris, the 200m champion in 2000, and Thanou have since been charged by the Greek authorities and await trial. At the Games, Adrian Annus (hammer), Robert Fazelas (discus) and Irina Korzhanenko (shot) were all stripped of their titles because of doping issues. Hungarian compatriots Annus and Fazelas both refused to give urine samples while Russian Korzhanenko tested positive for the steroid stanozolol. The fallout from the THG scandal, which rocked the sport in 2003, continued to impact in Olympic year. Britain's 4x100m team took gold without the services of Dwain Chambers, who was handed a two-year ban in February after testing positive for steroid THG. American Kelli White was suspended and stripped of her world 100m and 200m titles after failing a drugs test. And world 400m champion Jerome Young landed a life ban from US chiefs after a second doping offence. Russian pole vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva provided some light relief by smashing the world record seven times on her way to the World Indoor and Olympic titles. Her rivalry with compatriot Svetlana Feofanova livened up the field events. Morocco's Hicham El Guerrouj also delighted fans by racing to a historic Olympic double in the 1500m and 5,000m. And though there was no Paula Radcliffe in the London Marathon, there was plenty of drama as Kenyans Evans Rutto and Margaret Okayo took the titles. Rutto held on to win despite slipping on some cobblestones and tumbling into a barrier. Okayo also had to battle back after mistiming her tactics but clinched victory on her debut.","Britain's Callum Smith was second in the men's 800m at the Athletissima meeting in Lausanne. But his run helped him retain his place at the top of the UK rankings. Smith, who finished in one minute 45.47 seconds, is now ranked third in Europe and fifth in the world. The 21-year-old is hoping to become Britain's first European 800m champion since David Jenkins in 1980. ""It was a good run and I am happy with my time,"" said Smith. ""It was a hard race, as I knew it would be."" Alan Webb of the USA set a new indoor world record for the mile on Saturday, clocking 3min 46.89sec at the Aviva Indoor Grand Prix in Boston. His time was 0.08sec quicker than Steve Scott's 25-year-old record for the distance. England's Paula Radcliffe, who missed last weekend's race through injury, remains top of the world rankings at 4,000m and 5,000m. The women's race at Athletissima was won by Kenyan Catherine Ndereba in one minute 58.82 seconds.

sport,Gardener Wins Double In Glasgow,"Britain's Jason Gardener enjoyed a double 60m success in Glasgow in his first competitive outing since he won 100m relay gold at the Athens Olympics. Gardener cruised home ahead of Scot Nick Smith to win the invitational race at the Norwich Union International. He then recovered from a poor start in the second race to beat Swede Daniel Persson and Italy's Luca Verdecchia. His times of 6.61 and 6.62 seconds were well short of American Maurice Greene's 60m world record of 6.39secs from 1998. ""It's a very hard record to break, but I believe I've trained very well,"" said the world indoor champion, who hopes to get closer to the mark this season. ""It was important to come out and make sure I got maximum points. My last race was the Olympic final and there was a lot of expectation. ""This was just what I needed to sharpen up and get some race fitness. I'm very excited about the next couple of months."" Double Olympic champion marked her first appearance on home soil since winning 1500m and 800m gold in Athens with a victory. There was a third success for Britain when edged out Russia's Olga Fedorova and Sweden's Jenny Kallur to win the women's 60m race in 7.23secs. Maduaka was unable to repeat the feat in the 200m, finishing down in fourth as took the win for Russia. And the 31-year-old also missed out on a podium place in the 4x200m relay as the British quartet came in fourth, with Russia setting a new world indoor record. There was a setback for Jade Johnson as she suffered a recurrence of her back injury in the long jump. Russia won the meeting with a final total of 63 points, with Britain second on 48 and France one point behind in third. led the way for Russia by producing a major shock in the high jump as he beat Olympic champion Stefan Holm into second place to end the Swede's 22-event unbeaten record. won the triple jump with a leap of 16.87m, with Britain's Tosin Oke fourth in 15.80m. won the men's pole vault competition with a clearance of 5.65m, with Britain's Nick Buckfield 51cm adrift of his personal best in third. And won the women's 800m, with Britain's Jenny Meadows third. There was yet another Russian victory in the women's 400m as finished well clear of Britain's Catherine Murphy. Chris Lambert had to settle for fourth after fading in the closing stages of the men's 200m race as Sweden's held off Leslie Djhone of France. France's won the men's 400m, with Brett Rund fourth for Britain. took victory for Sweden in the women's 60m hurdles ahead of Russia's Irina Shevchenko and Britain's Sarah Claxton, who set a new personal best. Italy grabbed their first victory in the men's 1500m as kicked over the last 200 metres to hold off Britain's James Thie and France's Alexis Abraham. A botched changeover in the 4x200m relay cost Britain's men the chance to add further points as France claimed victory.","Edinburgh's Michael Grant won the men's and women's 100m sprints at the Muller Indoor Grand Prix. His time of 10.22 seconds in the men's race was a personal best and gave him victory over Jamaica's Asafa Powell. Powell had been odds-on to win the men's race but he finished second, ahead of Olympic champion Maurice Greene. The American pulled up with a hamstring injury after leading for most of the 60 metres race. He will have tests before deciding whether or not to compete in next month's 2005 indoor championships in Madrid. In the women's race, Scotland's Susan Scott produced a personal best time of 11.65 seconds to beat US sprinter Torri Edwards in a tight finish. Edwards won the women's 60m title, with 20-year-old Veronica Campbell clocking a time of 7.05 seconds to finish second behind the American.

""I'm definitely going to rest and try to get myself ready for Madrid."" Scottish sprinter Craig Caldwell, who came fourth in the 60m behind Edwards, said: ""It's very disappointing for Maurice but there are other guys who can step up and win in Madrid.""

sport,Classy Henman Makes Winning Start,"Tim Henman opened his 2005 campaign with a 6-1 7-5 victory over Argentine David Nalbandian at the Kooyong Classic exhibition tournament on Wednesday. The British number one will next play Roger Federer at the Australian Open warm-up event on Friday. The world number one beat Gaston Gaudio 5-7 6-1 6-4, before Andre Agassi saw off Chilean Olympic gold medalist Nicolas Massu 6-1 7-6 (7-4). Andy Roddick beat Ivan Ljubicic, who replaced Paradorn Srichaphan, 6-1 6-4. Henman made an impressive start to the year, only faltering against Nalbandian when serving for the match at 5-4. But the Briton regained his composure to win the next two games for only his second win in six matches against the Argentine. ""It's a great start to the year - just what I was looking for,"" Henman told his website. ""Over the years I've found David very difficult to play against. ""He returns serve very well and he's deceptively effective from the baseline, so sometimes it can be difficult to execute my gameplan well enough against him to get the right result. ""Beating somebody of his stature is always good for the confidence and it bodes well at the beginning of the year."" Henman also revealed the extent of the back problems he suffered in the off-season. ""I'm not the most flexible and at the end of the year I was pretty exhausted and wanted to have a couple of weeks where I didn't do anything,"" said Henman. ""When I started training again it really, really seized up. As much as I enjoyed the two weeks off I don't think it's so productive."" Federer dropped a tight first set against 2004 French Open champion Gaudio, but was content with his game. ""It was about getting used to the surface,"" he said. ""The conditions are much quicker than Doha, my timing was OK, but I could have served better. ""All in all I'm happy with the match, and I won it - that's a good sign. Now I have a day off and hopefully play better the next match."" Agassi was delighted with victory over Massu in his first match for over two months. ""I felt pretty good,"" said the American. ""I liked the way the match played out and, maybe excluding a few second serve returns, I felt like I was doing most things pretty darn well for the first match.""","Tim Henman is through to the second round of the Qatar ExxonMobil Open after a 6-2 6-2 win over South Africa's Wayne Ferrier. The Briton, who has won the tournament twice, broke his opponent's serve five times in the first round clash in Doha. Ferrier struggled against the accuracy and variety of Henman, who rarely faced a break point. ""It was a good performance,"" said Henman. ""I'm very happy with the way I played and pleased to get through in straight sets."" The 30-year-old will next face either Spain's Tommy Robredo or Argentina's Jose Luis Clavet. ""I played well but I made too many errors,"" said Ferrier. ""I just couldn't get myself going."" The 33-year-old looked like he might spring a surprise when he broke to take the first game but from then on it was one-way traffic. Henman broke back in the fourth game and then broke again in the eighth game, leaving Ferrier battling to stay in the contest. The Briton broke again in the 11th game before closing out the first set with a trademark volley and then broke again in the fourth game of the second set before wrapping up victory with a superb lob. ""Winning here two times makes you want to do it again and I came here very determined to have a strong year,"" added Henman, who also reached the final at Sydney last week where he lost to Andy R"
sport,Chelsea Sack Mutu,"Chelsea have sacked Adrian Mutu after he failed a drugs test. The 25-year-old tested positive for a banned substance - which he later denied was cocaine - in October. Chelsea have decided to write off a possible transfer fee for Mutu, a �15.8m signing from Parma last season, who may face a two-year suspension. A statement from Chelsea explaining the decision read:""We want to make clear that Chelsea has a zero tolerance policy towards drugs."" Mutu scored six goals in his first five games after arriving at Stamford Bridge but his form went into decline and he was frozen out by coach Jose Mourinho. Chelsea's statement added: ""This applies to both performance-enhancing drugs or so-called 'recreational' drugs. They have no place at our club or in sport. ""In coming to a decision on this case, Chelsea believed the club's social responsibility to its fans, players, employees and other stakeholders in football regarding drugs was more important than the major financial considerations to the company. ""Any player who takes drugs breaches his contract with the club as well as Football Association rules. ""The club totally supports the FA in strong action on all drugs cases."" Fifa's disciplinary code stipulates that a first doping offence should be followed by a six-month ban. And the sport's world governing body has re-iterated their stance over Mutu's failed drugs test, maintaining it is a matter for the domestic sporting authorities. ""Fifa is not in a position to make any comment on the matter until the English FA have informed us of their disciplinary decision and the relevant information associated with it,"" said a Fifa spokesman. Chelsea's move won backing from drug-testing expert Michelle Verroken. Verroken, a former director of drug-free sport for UK Sport, insists the Blues were right to sack Mutu and have enhanced their reputation by doing so. ""Chelsea are saying quite clearly to the rest of their players and their fans that this is a situation they are not prepared to tolerate. ""It was a very difficult decision for them and an expensive decision for them but the terms of his contract were breached and it was the only decision they could make. ""It is a very clear stance by Chelsea and it has given a strong boost to the reputation of the club."" It emerged that Mutu had failed a drugs test on October 18 and, although it was initially reported that the banned substance in question was cocaine. The Romanian international later suggested it was a substance designed to enhance sexual performance. The Football Association has yet to act on Mutu's failed drugs test and refuses to discuss his case.","Chelsea have sacked striker Adrian Mutu after he failed to turn up for training three days before a Premier League game. The Romanian international was dropped for Saturday's 1-0 defeat at Liverpool, hours after he failed to turn up at the club's training ground. ""Chelsea Football Club can confirm that Adrian Mutu no longer plays for the club,"" said a statement. Mutu was fined by Chelsea for missing a training session before the Champions League game against Sparta Prague earlier this month. The 25-year-old had already been disciplined by the club for unauthorised trips to Italy and was warned about his future conduct. A statement from Chelsea on Saturday said: ""Following his latest breach of discipline, Adrian Mutu has been suspended pending further disciplinary action by the club."" The statement came moments after Chelsea manager Claudio Ranieri had told reporters that Mutu was still a Chelsea player. ""He is suspended from training, but I don't know what will happen in the future,"" said Ranieri. ""He is not in the squad and he is suspended, that is all I know."" Mutu has scored four goals in 17 appearances this season. The 25-year-old cost £12m when he joined from Fiorentina in August 2003. He was fined £20,000 and warned about his future conduct by Chelsea following his late arrival for the Champions League game against Sparta Prague on 20 October.

The Group Four fixtures were hammered out at a meeting in Dublin on Tuesday. The Irish open their campaign on 4 September at home to Cyprus and wrap up the 10-match series on 12 October 2005, with the visit of Switzerland.

The Scots, who beat Ireland 29-21 in the opening game of this season's championship, will complete the campaign in Dublin. France complete the top three in the annual tournament after their win over Wales earlier in the day. Wales' loss means they will not be involved in next season's Heineken Cup, while Scotland and Ireland will be in the second tier. France travel to face Italy and England go to Wales, while Italy host Scotland and Wales entertain Ireland. Scotland have not won in Dublin since a 28-22 victory on 5 February, 1983. But Ireland have lost just twice at home since then - to New Zealand in November 2000 and to South Africa last November. They have won five of their last six Six Nations matches at Lansdowne Road, with their only defeat coming against France in February 2003. The other games see Italy host England at the Stadio Flaminio in Rome and Wales face Scotland at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. England will be hoping to go one better than last season when they lost to France in the final at the Stade de France. Coach Andy Robinson has promised Scotland will do everything they can to finish second behind champions England. ""I am delighted,"" said Robinson. ""It is a tough game, but we want to be playing tough games at the end of the championship, and I hope Ireland are feeling the same way."" Scotland captain Craig Russell believes a win would"
sport,O'Gara Revels In Ireland Victory,"Ireland fly-half Ronan O'Gara hailed his side's 19-13 victory over England as a ""special"" win. The Munster number 10 kicked a total of 14 points, including two drop goals, to help keep alive their Grand Slam hopes. He told BBC Sport: ""We made hard work of it but it's still special to beat England. ""I had three chances to win the game but didn't. We have work to do after this but we never take a victory over England lightly."" Ireland hooker Shane Byrne echoed O'Gara's comments but admitted the game had been England's best outing in the Six Nations. Byrne said: ""It was a really, really hard game but from one to 15 in our team we worked really, really hard. ""We just had to stick to our defensive pattern, trust ourselves and trust those around us. All round it was fantastic."" Ireland captain Brian O'Driscoll, who scored his side's only try, said: ""We are delighted, we felt if we performed well then we would win but with England also having played very well it makes it all the sweeter. ""We did get the bounce of the ball and some days that happens and you've just got to jump on the back of it."" Ireland coach Eddie O'Sullivan was surprised that England coach Andy Robinson said he was certain Mark Cueto was onside for a disallowed try just before the break. ""Andy was sitting two yards from me and I couldn't see whether he was offside or not so I don't know how Andy could have known,"" said O'Sullivan. ""What I do know is that England played well and when that happens it makes a very good victory for us. ""We had to defend for long periods and that is all good for the confidence of the team. ""I think our try was very well worked, it was a gem, as good a try as we have scored for a while."" O'Sullivan also rejected Robinson's contention England dominated the forward play. ""I think we lost one lineout and they lost four or five so I don't know how that adds up to domination,"" he said. O'Driscoll also insisted Ireland were happy to handle the pressure of being considered favourites to win the Six Nations title. ""This season for the first time we have been able to play with the favourites' tag,"" he said. ""Hopefully we have proved that today and can continue to keep doing so. ""As for my try it was a move we had worked on all week. There was a bit of magic from Geordan Murphy and it was a great break from Denis Hickie.""","Ronan O'Gara hailed Ireland's gutsy display to secure a Six Nations victory over France as the ""best yet"". The fly-half kicked all Ireland's points in a hard-fought 17-6 victory as Les Bleus failed to register a single try. ""It was the best performance we have put in in the Six Nations, and I think it was evident in the way we defended,"" said O'Gara. ""I'm happy with my own performance but the most important thing is that the team played well."" O'Gara, who had been struggling with a calf injury, hit back at criticism of his kicking and said he had no regrets about his decision to play. ""The ball didn't want to go over but it's not as if I missed loads of kicks. Some of them couldn't have been any closer and I'm happy with my performance overall. ""You're going to get stick as a fly-half but I'm happy with the way I'm playing."" Ireland were forced to hang on in the closing stages after Pascal Papé was sin-binned in the 69th minute for a reckless challenge on Gordon D'Arcy. France failed to take advantage of their numerical advantage, however, and Ireland held firm for a vital victory ahead of their final two matches against Scotland and Italy. ""This win is massive,"" added O'Gara. ""We have beaten the biggest team in Europe so this will give us huge confidence going forward"
sport,Paris Promise Raises Welsh Hopes,"Has there been a better Six Nations match than Saturday's epic in Paris? And can the Welsh revival continue all the way to a first Grand Slam since 1978? Those are the two questions occupying not just Wales supporters but rugby fans as a whole after a scintillating display in Paris. Welsh legend Mervyn Davies, a member of two of three Grand Slam-winning sides of the 1970s, hailed it as ""one of the great performances of the past three decades"". Martyn Williams, Wales' two-try scorer on the day, called it ""one of the most surreal games I have ever played in"". A crestfallen France coach, Bernard Laporte, simply observed: ""There was a French half and there was a Welsh half"". And what a half it was for the Red Dragonhood, transforming a 15-6 half-time deficit into an 18-15 lead within five mesmerising minutes of the second period. But while that passage of play showed the swelling self-belief of a side prepared to back its own spirit of adventure, the final quarter told us a whole lot more about this Welsh side. That they recovered from a battering in the first half-hour to first stem the tide before half-time, then reverse it on the resumption, was remarkable enough. But in resisting a seemingly unstoppable wave of French pressure in a nail-biting final five minutes, Wales showed not only their physical attributes but their mental resolve. In international rugby, any of the top seven sides can beat each other on a given day, but the great sides are those that win the close contests on a consistent basis. England suffered some infamous Six Nations disappointments en route to World Cup glory, the pain of defeat forging bonds that ultimately led to victory when it really mattered. Wales have some way to go before they can be remotely considered in a similar light. But the signs are that players previously on the receiving end are learning how to emerge on the right side of the scoreline. Ten of the 22 on duty on Saturday were also involved when Wales were trounced 33-5 in Paris two years ago. But since they threw off the shackles against New Zealand in the 2003 World Cup, Wales have rediscovered much of what made them a great rugby nation in the first place. ""The confidence in the squad has been building and building since the World Cup and we now have young players who are becoming world class,"" noted coach Mike Ruddock. The likes of Michael Owen, Gethin Jenkins, Dwayne Peel and Gavin Henson are certainly building strong cases for inclusion on this summer's Lions tour to New Zealand. And players like Stephen Jones, Martyn Williams, Shane Williams and Gareth Thomas are proving it is not only the youngsters that are on an upward curve. Jones, after his superb man-of-the-match display, observed that ""we are a very happy camp now"". Ruddock and Thomas can take much of the credit for that, ensuring the tribal and regional divisions that have often scarred Welsh rugby do not extend to the national squad. The joie de vivre so evident in that magical second-half spell in Paris also stems from a style of play that first wooed supporters the world over in the 1970s. If England had half the innate attacking exuberance Wales have produced in this championship, they would not be contemplating the debris of three consecutive defeats. Similarly, Wales have learnt that style alone does not win matches, and that forward power, mental toughness and good decision-making under pressure are equally important. So on to Murrayfield, where Wales have not won on their last three visits. While the hype in the Principality will go into overdrive, the players will set about the task of beating Scotland. Only then - with the visit of Ireland to finish - can they start thinking about emulating the hallowed players of the 1970s, and writing their own names into Welsh legend.","Wales' hopes of hosting the 2015 Rugby World Cup final have been boosted after the president of the International Rugby Board (IRB) pledged his support. Bernard Lapasset met Wales' First Minister Rhodri Morgan and said he was confident that a strong bid could be put together. ""Rugby has never been more popular and I am sure that the Welsh people will make their country the success story of 2015,"" said Mr Lapasset. ""Bernard Lapasset has given us the personal commitment that he will use all his influence to help Wales win the right to host what will be a spectacular Rugby World Cup."" The WRU wants to build on the success of this year's Six Nations Championship, which was won by Wales for the third time in eight years. And Mr Morgan believes that Wales' status as one of rugby's leading lights will help boost their chances. ""Wales is at the heart of world rugby and this bid is a great opportunity for everyone in Wales to embrace rugby's passion and enthusiasm,"" he said. ""With the facilities already in place, and Wales' reputation for hosting major events, I am confident that Wales will be a standout contender for what promises to be a fantastic tournament."" The IRB is due to decide where the 2015 World Cup will be played in August next year. South Africa is also expected to bid, but no other countries have yet declared their intentions. The 2011 World Cup will take place in New Zealand, with Australia staging the 2003 tournament"
sport,Hearts 2-1 Livingston,"Hearts wrapped up their Scottish Cup quarter-final tie against Livingston with two goals in the first 10 minutes. Lee Miller scored inside the opening 60 seconds, heading over Colin Meldrum and into the net from a Jamie McAllister free kick. McAllister himself scored the second when he met Saul Mikoliunas' cross at the back post to put the game beyond the visitors. Craig Easton headed in a controversial goal after an hour but Hearts held on. The opening goal came after Gus Bahoken had clumsily fouled Miller 35 yards from goal. McAllister floated the free kick into the Livi box and Miller outjumped the static visiting defence to loop his header from 10 yards over Meldrum. With just 10 minutes on the clock, the home side doubled their lead. Mikoliunas sprinted down the right, crossed to the back post where McAllister raced in to head past Meldrum. Moments later Miller came close to grabbing his second with a first-time drive from 16 yards, which skimmed the bar. Then McAllister picked up a pass from Stephen Simmons and drove an angled shot from 20 yards narrowly past Meldrum's far post. The impressive Mikoliunas twice went close before half time - a low drive was comfortably gathered by Meldrum and then he curled a left-footed shot past the keeper's right-hand post. Livi manager Richard Gough made three changes at the interval, bringing on defender Goran Stanic, midfielder Gabor Vincze, and striker Ferenc Horvath for Bahoken, Derek Lilley and Mark Wilson. But, in the opening stages of the second period, little changed. However, the West Lothian side gave themselves a lifeline with a controversial goal. Eric Deloumeaux sent Jason Dair away on the right and he tried to give the ball to McPake, who looked to be in an offside position. The Livi striker ignored the pass, however, and Dair ran on to it and played Easton in at the back post and he headed home from close range. The home side called for offside against McPake but referee Alan Freeland ignored their claims and pointed to the centre-circle. Livi went all out for the equaliser. In the 87th minute, Burton O'Brien was hauled back at the edge of the box by Neil MacFarlane, but Dair sent his shot just inches wide.

But the home side equalised thanks to a fine free-kick from Neil McCann. And McCann and Craig Beattie then combined to put the home side ahead. With just under 20 minutes to go, Beattie chased down a long ball into the Livi box, nipped in front of the goalkeeper and guided the ball home from an acute angle. Hearts were forced to play the last 10 minutes with 10 men after keeper Nicky Weaver was sent off for fouling Scott Arfield as he tried to run clear on goal. But Livi failed to make any headway against their reduced opposition and held on for their third draw of the season. Livi made a bright start and O'Connor should have put them ahead after three minutes when he shot wildly over the bar from only eight yards out after good work by David Bingham. The visitors were becoming increasingly edgy as they struggled to find their feet in the game, with Andy Webster shooting well wide from an acute angle after 14 minutes. The breakthrough came against the run of play on 19 minutes and it was a special goal from O'Connor. He picked up a pass on the edge of the Hearts box, shifted the ball onto his left foot and curled a delicious shot into the top corner, giving keeper Nicky Weaver no chance. That"
sport,Italy Aim To Rattle England,"Italy coach John Kirwan believes his side can upset England as the Six Nations wooden spoon battle hots up. The two sides, both without a win, meet on 12 March at Twickenham and Kirwan says his side will be hoping to make the most of England's current slump. ""We have to make sure the England and France games are tough for them. ""England have not been having the best of championships. That is a big one for us and them and I am sure my players will rise to the occasion,"" he said. But Kirwan admits that a lot of hard work will be needed with his kickers before the trip to London. Roland de Marigny and Luciano Orquera had a miserable time with the boot in the dire defeat to Scotland as Chris Paterson stole the show to give the hosts a much-needed 18-10 victory. Kirwan said: ""The kicking was the decisive factor in Scotland which cost us and it could go down to the kicking again next time. ""But I have a lot of confidence in my players and I am positive we can put everything together against England."" England, meanwhile, are licking their wounds and rueing what might have been had two decisions from referee Jonathan Kaplan not gone against them in the second half in Dublin. First Mark Cueto was judged offside as he chased fly-half Charlie Hodgson's kick, and then Kaplan opted not to call upon video evidence to see if Josh Lewsey had touched down after being driven over Ireland's line. But centre Jamie Noon believes the side at least showed better form than their previous two defeats. ""We definitely improved against an in-form Irish side,"" he said. ""We went to Dublin quietly confident that we would be able to compete, and I think we showed that. ""We have got to make sure we now take the form and positives into the Italy game. We are under no illusions that it is going to be easy, but we definitely need a win."" England have now equalled an 18-year low of four successive championship defeats, including France in Paris last season, and have lost four in a row under Andy Robinson. His predecessor, Sir Clive Woodward, began his seven-year reign with three defeats and two draws.","Italy coach Clive Woodward expects Italy's abrasive approach to the game at Twickenham on Saturday. ""There's no doubt that Italy will come out of the blocks with real physical intent,"" said Woodward. ""They're going to be very well prepared and they'll want to intimidate us. ""We mustn't let that happen but I don't think they'll change their whole gameplan. There's no reason why they should."" England have yet to beat Italy in five attempts and their latest encounter was a bruising encounter in Rome last year. But Woodward is confident his side will come out of the other side of this weekend's contest with their reputation intact. ""It's a very important game for us,"" he added. ""I think we've got a very good chance of winning but it's going to be a very tough match and we've got to make sure we're up for it from the first minute."" Woodward, who will name his team on Thursday, is also relishing the prospect of another tough encounter with Italy. ""It's great for me as a coach to have these sorts of games,"" he said. ""They're intense, hard contests and I wouldn't have it any other way."" Woodward has not been surprised by the impact made by Italy's new coach Jacques Brunel. ""I think Jacques has done a fantastic job,"" said Woodward. ""They play a very aggressive type of rugby and always have done.""

tech,Chip Maker Backs Net Phone Calls,"Rich Templeton, the head of giant chip maker Texas Instruments, has given his backing to the growing sector of Voice over Internet Telephony (Voip) Voip allows PC users, and in some cases those with just a broadband connection, to make telephone calls via the net. Mr Templeton said Voip would be the next major application to drive broadband connections into homes. Internet service provider Wanadoo has announced it is launching its own broadband telephony service in the UK. Subscribers to Wanadoo's broadband service will be able to use the service to make free evening and weekend calls to any UK landline, and free calls at any time to other Wanadoo users. The service will cost an extra £4 a month and will come with a free Livebox, the broadband hub which Wanadoo plans will be used in future to provide video-on-demand and home security services. The secondary phone line will mean customers can have an extra home phone number and will also provide wireless internet access around the home. Eventually the service will replace existing landline services as Wanadoo goes head to head with BT. ""Voice-over broadband is a key trend across Europe and is set to have a dramatic impact on the telecommunications industry, "" Eric Abensur, Wanadoo's chief executive told the BBC News website. Mr Templeton said he agreed. ""Voice-over-packet is going to be the second killer application after broadband internet access,"" he said. The world's largest maker of chips for mobile phones believes the technology will grow rapidly from the relatively small user base it has currently. Almost 83 million people have downloaded the software that powers the Skype Voip service, according to the net telephony firm's website. Skype lets people make free calls to other Skype users and also make low-cost calls to ordinary phone numbers. US firm Vonage also offers a Voip service, but one which lets people plug an ordinary phone into a broadband router to make calls. Bill Simmelink, general manager of TI's Voip business, said the technology would only take off when people were making net calls with the ease of making a normal call. ""It's not about the pipe, if you will, or the silicon per se, it's about the application,"" he said. ""We want to communicate freely, effortlessly and economically wherever we are."" In a sign that Voip is seeping into the mainstream, giant ISP AOL announced on Tuesday that it had plans to launch a net-based phone service for some of its members within the month. Customers will continue to use their traditional phones, but they will plug them into adapters connected to their broadband source rather than the jack provided by the telephone company. Calls are received and placed just like on the old telephone network. ""We can help mass-market adoption of Voip,"" said AOL chief executive Jonathan Miller. ""We can utilise our national footprint. We can help the entire industry become well known.""","ARM Holdings, the UK-based chip designer, has unveiled a technology it says could let people make phone calls over PCs and home networks. ARM has signed a deal with Microsoft to integrate its technology into the next version of Windows for netbooks, due in 2010. The partnership will also see ARM providing key technology for Microsoft's next version of Office. The move is expected to let netbook users make voice calls using the same software they use to instant message and e-mail. ARM's new technology makes use of the growing number of home networks that support voice over IP (VoIP), a standard that lets people make phone calls using the internet. By integrating VoIP into its chips, ARM believes it can make it easier for firms to produce netbooks with built-in VoIP capabilities. ""We believe that the next wave of computing devices will need to have integrated VoIP,"" said Phil Hughes, director of strategy and product development at ARM. ""What we are seeing is an increasing number of households getting broadband and wanting to use their computers as phones too."" The two firms announced their partnership at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, where ARM also unveiled a new chip that is expected to power many of next year's netbooks. ARM's new processor, codenamed Zeus, is based on the firm's widely used ARM11 architecture. The chip can be used to power netbooks or desktop computers with low power requirements. The company hopes Zeus will help drive down the"
tech,Iran Jails Blogger For 14 Years,"An Iranian weblogger has been jailed for 14 years on charges of spying and aiding foreign counter-revolutionaries. Arash Sigarchi was arrested last month after using his blog to criticise the arrest of other online journalists. Mr Sigarchi, who also edits a newspaper in northern Iran, was sentenced by a revolutionary court in the Gilan area. His sentence, criticised by human rights watchdog Reporters Without Borders, comes a day after an online ""day of action"" to secure his release. Iranian authorities have recently clamped down on the growing popularity of weblogs, restricting access to major blogging sites from within Iran. A second Iranian blogger, Motjaba Saminejad, who also used his website to report on bloggers' arrests, is still being held. A spokesman for Reporters Without Borders, which tracks press freedom across the globe, described Mr Sigarchi's sentence as ""harsh"" and called on Iranian President Mohammed Khatami to work to secure his immediate release. ""The authorities are trying to make an example of him,"" the organisation said in a statement. ""By handing down this harsh sentence against a weblogger, their aim is to dissuade journalists and internet-users from expressing themselves online or contacting foreign media."" In the days before his arrest Mr Sigarchi gave interviews to the BBC Persian Service and the US-funded Radio Farda. Iranian authorities have arrested about 20 online journalists during the current crackdown. They accused Mr Sigarchi of a string of crimes against Iranian state, including espionage, insulting the founder of Iran's Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomenei, and current Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Mr Sigarchi's lawyer labelled the revolutionary court ""illegal and incompetent"" and called for a retrial in a public court. Mr Sigarchi was sentenced one day after an online campaign highlighted his case in a day of action in defence of bloggers around the world. The Committee to Protect Bloggers designated 22 February 2005 as Free Mojtaba and Arash Day. Around 10,000 people visited the campaign's website during the day. About 12% of users were based in Iran, the campaign's director told the BBC News website. Curt Hopkins said Mr Sigarchi's sentence would not dent the resolve of bloggers joining the campaign to help highlight the case. ""The eyes of 8 million bloggers are going to be more focused on Iran since Sigarchi's sentence, not less. ""The mullahs won't be able to make a move without it be spread across the blogosphere.""","A blogger in Iran has been sentenced to 14 years in jail and 74 lashes for insulting the country's Supreme Leader and President. Issa Saharkhiz was found guilty by a Revolutionary Court in Tehran of publishing lies and insulting Ayatollah Khamenei and President Mohammad Khatami. Mr Saharkhiz's website, Jamejam Online, is one of several sites shut down by Iranian authorities in recent months. Several other bloggers are also being held in Iran on similar charges. The court found Mr Saharkhiz guilty of publishing information about corruption and nepotism in government, as well as articles critical of the country's leadership. Mr Saharkhiz was also accused of being a leader of the Iranian opposition group, the People's Mujahideen Organisation of Iran (PMOI), although he has denied having any links with the group. The BBC's Tehran correspondent Frances Harrison said dissidents often use websites to post information about government corruption, but that these sites are also often used to attack each other. Mr Saharkhiz, who was arrested in October, was also accused of being an agent for the US and Israel, which he also denies. The court's verdict can be appealed. Another jailed Iranian blogger is expected to go on trial soon. Omidblog has been closed since December and its editor could face similar charges. He is believed to be Omid Mirsayahi, who writes about social issues and has more than 1,400 subscribers to his site's weblog"
tech,Internet Boom For Gift Shopping,"Cyberspace is becoming a very popular destination for Christmas shoppers. Forecasts predict that British people will spend £4bn buying gifts online during the festive season, an increase of 64% on 2003. Surveys also show that the average amount that people are spending is rising, as is the range of goods that they are happy to buy online. Savvy shoppers are also using the net to find the hot presents that are all but sold out in High Street stores. Almost half of the UK population now shop online according to figures collected by the Interactive Media in Retail Group which represents web retailers. About 85% of this group, 18m people, expect to do a lot of their Christmas gift buying online this year, reports the industry group. On average each shopper will spend £220 and Britons lead Europe in their affection for online shopping. Almost a third of all the money spent online this Christmas will come out of British wallets and purses compared to 29% from German shoppers and only 4% from Italian gift buyers. James Roper, director of the IMRG, said shoppers were now much happier to buy so-called big ticket items such as LCD television sets and digital cameras. Mr Roper added that many retailers were working hard to reassure consumers that online shopping was safe and that goods ordered as presents would arrive in time for Christmas. He advised consumers to give shops a little more time than usual to fulfil orders given that online buying is proving so popular. A survey by Hostway suggests that many men prefer to shop online to avoid the embarrassment of buying some types of presents, such as lingerie, for wives and girlfriends. Much of this online shopping is likely to be done during work time, according to research carried out by security firm Saint Bernard Software. The research reveals that up to two working days will be lost by staff who do their shopping via their work computer. Worst offenders will be those in the 18-35 age bracket, suggests the research, who will spend up to five hours per week in December browsing and buying at online shops. Iggy Fanlo, chief revenue officer at Shopping.com, said that the growing numbers of people using broadband was driving interest in online shopping. ""When you consider narrowband and broadband the conversion to sale is two times higher,"" he said. Higher speeds meant that everything happened much faster, he said, which let people spend time browsing and finding out about products before they buy. The behaviour of online shoppers was also changing, he said. ""The single biggest reason people went online before this year was price,"" he said. ""The number one reason now is convenience."" ""Very few consumers click on the lowest price,"" he said. ""They are looking for good prices and merchant reliability."" Consumer comments and reviews were also proving popular with shoppers keen to find out who had the most reliable customer service. Data collected by eBay suggests that some smart shoppers are getting round the shortages of hot presents by buying them direct through the auction site. According to eBay UK there are now more than 150 Robosapiens remote control robots for sale via the site. The Robosapiens toy is almost impossible to find in online and offline stores. Similarly many shoppers are turning to eBay to help them get hold of the hard-to-find slimline PlayStation 2, which many retailers are only selling as part of an expensive bundle. The high demand for the PlayStation 2 has meant that prices for it are being driven up. In shops the PS2 is supposed to sell for £104.99. In some eBay UK auctions the price has risen to more than double this figure. Many people are also using eBay to get hold of gadgets not even released in this country. The portable version of the PlayStation has only just gone on sale in Japan yet some enterprising eBay users are selling the device to UK gadget fans.","Internet shoppers are increasingly using the net to buy presents for loved ones, a survey suggests. The annual Netwatch survey found that 24% of people bought at least one present online in 2004, up from 16% the previous year. Online shoppers were also more likely to buy a gift for someone they did not know well, the survey found. Almost a quarter (24%) of all shoppers bought something online for a present, compared with 20% in 2003. But despite the increasing popularity of online shopping, the vast majority of people still prefer to go to a shop to buy their presents. Three quarters of shoppers said they visited shops in person to buy gifts, compared to just over a third who bought online. The Netwatch survey found that men were twice as likely as women to buy online, and younger people are more likely than older people to use the net to buy gifts. The biggest proportion of online shoppers - 34% - bought presents for people they did not know well, such as colleagues, compared with 20% who bought gifts for family members and 17% who bought presents for friends. The survey was carried out before the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the UK population had topped 60 million at Christmas 2004. ONS figures showed that spending on Christmas presents rose by 5% last year to £11bn. But the Netwatch survey showed that although people were buying more presents overall, they were spending less on each item. The average cost of each gift fell from £8.55 in"
tech,Cyber Crime Booms In 2004,"The last 12 months have seen a dramatic growth in almost every security threat that plague Windows PCs. The count of known viruses broke the 100,000 barrier and the number of new viruses grew by more than 50%. Similarly phishing attempts, in which conmen try to trick people into handing over confidential data, are recording growth rates of more than 30% and attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Also on the increase are the number of networks of remotely controlled computers, called bot nets, used by malicious hackers and conmen to carry out many different cyber crimes. One of the biggest changes of 2004 was the waning influence of the boy hackers keen to make a name by writing a fast-spreading virus, said Kevin Hogan, senior manager in Symantec's security response group. Although teenage virus writers will still play around with malicious code, said Mr Hogan, 2004 saw a significant rise in criminal use of malicious programs. The financial incentives were driving criminal use of technology, he said. His comment was echoed by Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant from anti-virus firm Sophos. Mr Cluley said: ""When the commercial world gets involved, things really get nasty. Virus writers and hackers will be looking to make a tidy sum."" In particular, phishing attacks, which typically use fake versions of bank websites to grab login details of customers, boomed during 2004. Web portal Lycos Europe reported a 500% increase in the number of phishing e-mail messages it was catching. The Anti-Phishing Working group reported that the number of phishing attacks against new targets was growing at a rate of 30% or more per month. Those who fall victim to these attacks can find that their bank account has been cleaned out or that their good name has been ruined by someone stealing their identity. This change in the ranks of virus writers could mean the end of the mass-mailing virus which attempts to spread by tricking people into opening infected attachments on e-mail messages. ""They are not an efficient way of spreading viruses,"" said Mr Hogan. ""They are very noisy and they are not technically challenging."" The opening months of 2004 did see the appearance of the Netsky, Bagle and MyDoom mass mailers, but since then more surreptitious viruses, or worms, have dominated. Mr Hogan said worm writers were more interested in recruiting PCs to take part in ""bot nets"" that can be used to send out spam or to mount attacks on websites. In September Symantec released statistics which showed that the numbers of active ""bot computers"" rose from 2,000 to 30,000 per day. Thanks to these ""bot nets"", spam continued to be a problem in 2004. Anti-spam firms report that, in many cases, legitimate e-mail has shrunk to less than 30% of messages. Part of the reason that these ""bot nets"" have become so prevalent, he said, was due to a big change in the way that many viruses were created. In the past many viruses, such as Netsky, have been the work of an individual or group. By contrast, said Mr Hogan, the code for viruses such as Gaobot, Spybot and Randex were commonly held and many groups work on them to produce new variants at the same time. The result is that now there are more than 3,000 variations of the Spybot worm. ""That's unprecedented,"" said Mr Hogan. ""What makes it difficult is that they are all co-existing with each other and do not exist in an easy to understand chronology."" The emergence of the first proper virus for mobile phones was also seen in 2004. In the past, threats to smart phones have been largely theoretical because the viruses created to cripple phones existed only in the laboratory rather than the wild. In June, the Cabir virus was discovered that can hop from phone to phone using Bluetooth short-range radio technology. Also released this year was the Mosquito game for Symbian phones which surreptitiously sends messages to premium rate numbers, and in November the Skulls Trojan came to light which can cripple phones. On the positive side, Finnish security firm F-Secure said that 2004 was the best-ever year for the capture, arrest and sentencing of virus writers and criminally-minded hackers. In total, eight virus writers were arrested and some members of the so-called 29A virus writing group were sentenced. One high-profile arrest was that of German teenager Sven Jaschen who confessed to be behind the Netsky and Sasser virus families. Also shut down were the Carderplanet and Shadowcrew websites that were used to trade stolen credit card numbers.","Cyber crime continues to grow as criminals exploit new technologies, according to a report. The 2004 Internet Security Threat Report (ISTR) by security firm Trend Micro found that viruses, spyware and spam continue to increase. The report found that the number of new viruses increased by 30% in 2004 compared to 2003, while spam volumes rose by 26%. ""The cyber criminal underworld is increasingly leveraging the latest technologies to further their illicit activities,"" said Rik Ferguson, director of security strategy at Trend Micro Europe. ""Trend Micro has identified a number of trends which will continue to shape the face of cyber crime in 2005."" The report found that spyware spread through instant messaging, while viruses are increasingly packaged as self-installing media files. The report found that the number of new malicious programs rose from 9,583 in 2003 to 12,826 in 2004 - a 30% increase. It also found that the average size of malicious programs has continued to grow from 6.7MB in 2003 to 7.4MB in 2004. Spam levels rose by 26% between 2003 and 2004, with the average size of a piece of spam increasing from 1.63MB to 1.87MB. The report also found that phishing - where people are tricked into revealing personal information such as credit card details - has become more sophisticated. There is also an increasing trend for phishing attacks to be aimed at specific groups of people - such as employees at a particular company. ""As more users become aware of ph"
tech,France Starts Digital Terrestrial,"France has become the last big European country to launch a digital terrestrial TV (DTT) service. Initially, more than a third of the population will be able to receive 14 free-to-air channels. Despite the long wait for a French DTT roll-out, the new platform's backers hope to emulate the success of its UK free-to-air counterpart, Freeview. Recent figures from the UK's regulator Ofcom showed Freeview was more popular than the Sky digital satellite service. In the three months to September 2004, almost five times as many people signed up to the UK's free-to-air DTT service compared with Sky. Almost 60% of UK households have gone digital on at least one television set through cable, satellite or Freeview. The French DTT platform is known as TNT, which stands for TV numerique terrestre or digital terrestrial television. But it is being branded as Television Numerique pour Tous, or ""digital television for all"". TNT is a joint venture between public broadcaster France Televisions and a handful of cable and satellite operators. Digital terrestrial TV will launch as a free-to-air platform to start with, adding pay-TV channels later. Thirty-five contenders have bid for an additional eight frequencies on top of the 14 already allocated. ""A couple of years ago, DTT had a bad image,"" said Olivier Gerolami, chief operating officer of TNT. ""But everyone's impressed with DTT in the UK, Italy and Germany, and they realise it is a very good idea. ""France is the poorest market in Europe in terms of free-to-air national channels, so it has the potential to be one of the biggest DTT markets,"" Mr Gerolami added in remarks quoted by the US entertainment industry paper Variety. TNT aims to reach 35% of France's population at launch, from 17 transmission sites. The transmission area will initially include Paris, Lille, Lyon and Toulouse. Eventually there will be 115 sites reaching over 80% of homes. Digital terrestrial set-top boxes are available from as little as 70 euros (£50). A recent survey by Mediametrie found that 70% of people interviewed were aware of DTT, and 25% were planning to buy a digital receiver. Consumer electronics companies such as Nokia, Sagem, Sony and Thomson are gearing up for production. The Conseil Superieur de l'Audiovisuel (CSA), the French broadcasting regulator, said: ""Following the recent success of Freeview in the UK, some manufacturers are optimistic about sales prospects"". Media analysts believe that initially the majority of viewers will buy inexpensive set-top boxes that are unable to support interactive services. The CSA said the current aim of reaching 85% of the population by 2007 was achievable, but the future of the remaining TV viewers required action by the public sector. For the most part, they are people living in mountainous or border areas, which will remain beyond the reach of digital terrestrial TV for years. Up to 15 pay-TV channels will launch on DTT between September 2005 and March 2006. Leading pay-TV operators Canal Plus and TPS have submitted bids to market bouquets of channels. Free-to-air services will be broadcast in MPEG-2 format. But pay-TV operators will be allowed to broadcast in MPEG-4 - a much better compression technology - which will potentially allow for high-definition (HD) subscription services in the future. TNT expects between 700,000 and one million DTT set-top boxes to be sold in 2005. ""It is difficult to tell how quickly it will take off,"" said Mr Gerolami, ""but we're optimistic that it will revolutionise television in France."" Other analysts were less optimistic, predicting consumers would now be less likely to sign up for pay-TV subscriptions. ""We think free DTT could put brakes on the underlying growth of pay-TV in France,"" said Henri de Bodinat, vice-president of the Arthur D. Little consultancy.","French TV viewers are going to get a chance to see how digital terrestrial TV works in practice from next month. France will start transmitting a trial service on Thursday 4 March which will be available to about 10,000 homes in the south-west of the country. The test transmissions will follow the DVB-T open standard for digital terrestrial TV, which has been agreed by the International Telecommunication Union. The BBC's Chris Nuttall says it is likely to prove popular with the French as they are traditionally early adopters of new products and services. France is due to start its main digital terrestrial TV service in July 2005. The service will cover 90% of the population and will be free for one year after launch. The trial service will come from a transmitter that is already being used to transmit analogue TV to the towns of La Rochelle, Royan, Cognac, Angoulême and Périgueux. Viewers will be able to use existing analogue receivers with a special adaptor to watch the new digital transmissions. The French digital terrestrial service will be known as Télévision Numérique Terrestre or TNT in France. Belgium and Switzerland are also planning to launch digital terrestrial services in 2005. Other European countries are also planning to launch services although there is still some uncertainty about when they will start transmitting and what technology they will use. In the UK, for example, there is still uncertainty about whether viewers will have to buy new digital TV sets or whether existing analogue sets"
tech,Satellite Mapping Aids Darfur Relief,"Aid workers trying to house, feed and clothe millions of homeless refugees in the Sudanese region of Darfur are getting a helping hand from advanced mapping technology. A European consortium of companies and university groups known as Respond is working to provide accurate and up to date maps. The aim is to overcome some of the huge logistical challenges in getting supplies to where they are needed. Respond is using satellite imagery to produce accurate maps that can be used in the field rapidly. ""Respond has produced very detailed maps for example for the road networks, for the rivers and for the villages, to more large-scale maps useful for very general planning purposes,"" said Einar Bjorgo from Unosat, the UN satellite mapping organisation that is part of the Respond consortium. The group uses satellites from Nasa, the European Space Agency and the Disaster Monitoring Constellation. The satellite data is transmitted to ground stations. From there, the information makes its way to Respond organisations that specialise in interpreting such data. ""You have to convert the data into images, then the interpreter has to convert all this into crisis, damage, or situation maps,"" said Stefan Voigt, who works in the remote sensing department of one of those organisations, the German Aerospace Centre. This kind of detailed analysis usually takes a couple of months but Respond gets it done in about 12 hours. ""Our users are usually not so much familiar with reading satellite imagery, reading satellite maps, so it's our task to transfer the data into information that non-technical people can read and understand easily and very, very efficiently,"" said Mr Voigt. Respond supplies maps to aid groups via the web, and on compact disc. But the best map is one you can hold in your hands, especially in remote areas where internet connections and laptops are scarce. ""A map is a working document,"" explains Herbert Hansen of Respond's Belgian partner Keyobs. ""You need to use it, you need to write on it, correct, give feedback and so on, so you need paper to write on. ""We print maps, we laminate the maps, we encapsulate the maps if needed so you can take a shower with the map, it's completely protected."" Humanitarian groups in Darfur have been making good use of Respond's maps. They have come in especially handy during Sudan's rainy season, when normally dry riverbeds, or wadis, became flooded. ""These wadis had a very small amount of flooding, generally, in terms of depth, but greatly impeded the transport capabilities and capacities of the humanitarian groups on the ground,"" says Stephen Candillon of Respond imaging partner Sertit. Respond's rapid imaging has allowed aid groups to find ways around the wadis, allowing then to mark on their maps which roads were washed out at which times. Aid groups say that combination of satellite technology and on-the-ground observation helped keep relief flowing to those who needed it. Clark Boyd is technology correspondent for The World, a BBC World Service and WGBH-Boston co-production","Satellite images of Sudan's Darfur region have been used to spot new refugee camps in the region. The images were collected by an EU satellite launched in December last year. They will be used to assess areas where humanitarian aid may be most needed, the European Space Agency said. Fighting has displaced more than 2.5 million people in Darfur since 2003, the UN says. The satellite images were taken between 1 January and 12 February and are due to be released on Friday. The images will help identify where to target aid efforts and where new camps have been built by refugees fleeing the conflict, the European Space Agency (Esa) said. The satellite is part of the Disaster Monitoring Constellation (DMC) - a group of four satellites which will provide continuous coverage of disaster zones. ""The DMC satellite images have already shown that there are some refugee camps in Darfur which were not known about before,"" said Esa spokesman Bernhard von Weyhe. The satellite images were processed by the UN's Operational Satellite Applications Programme (Unosat) and will be used by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and other humanitarian organisations. The EU has also set up a humanitarian task force to focus on relief efforts in Sudan's Darfur region. The task force is made up of representatives from 15 countries including the US and Canada, as well as the EU itself. Jan Egeland, who heads the task force, said: ""The satellite imagery is a very important"
tech,'Evil Twin' Fear For Wireless Net,"People using wireless high-speed net (wi-fi) are being warned about fake hotspots, or access points. The latest threat, nicknamed evil twins, pose as real hotspots but are actually unauthorised base stations, say Cranfield University experts. Once logged onto an Evil Twin, sensitive data can be intercepted. Wi-fi is becoming popular as more devices come with wireless capability. London leads the global wi-fi hotspots league, with more than 1,000. The number of hotspots is expected to reach 200,000 by 2008, according to analysts. ""Users need to be wary of using their wi-fi enabled laptops or other portable devices in order to conduct financial transactions or anything that is of a sensitive or personal nature,"" said Professor Brian Collins, head of information systems at Cranfield University. ""Users can also protect themselves by ensuring that their wi-fi device has its security measures activated,"" he added. BT Openzone, which operates a vast proportion of public hotspots in the UK, told the BBC News website that it made every effort to make its wi-fi secure. ""Naturally, people may have security concerns,"" said Chris Clark, chief executive for BT's wireless broadband. ""But wi-fi networks are no more or less vulnerable than any other means of accessing the internet, like broadband or dial-up."" He said BT Openzone, as well as others, have sophisticated encryption from the start of the login process to the service at a hotspot. ""This means that users' personal information and data, logon usernames and passwords are protected and secure,"" said Mr Clark. In the vast majority of cases, base stations straight out of the box from the manufacturers are automatically set up with the least secure mode possible, said Dr Nobles. Cybercriminals who try to glean personal information using the scam, jam connections to a legitimate base station by sending a stronger signal near to the wireless client. Anyone with the right gear can find a real hotspot and substitute it with an evil twin. ""Cybercriminals don't have to be that clever to carry out such an attack,"" said Dr Phil Nobles, a wireless net and cybercrime expert at Cranfield. ""Because wireless networks are based on radio signals they can be easily detected by unauthorised users tuning into the same frequency."" Although wi-fi is increasing in popularity as more people want to use high-speed net on the move, there have been fears over how secure it is. Some companies have been reluctant to use them in large numbers because of fears about security. A wireless network that is not protected can provide a backdoor into a company's computer system. Public wi-fi hotspots offered by companies like BT Openzone and The Cloud, are accessible after users sign up and pay for use. But many home and company wi-fi networks are left unprotected and can be ""sniffed out"" and hi-jacked by anyone with the correct equipment. ""BT advises that customers should change all default settings, make sure that their security settings on all equipment are configured correctly,"" said Mr Clark. ""We also advocate the use of personal firewalls to ensure that only authorised users can have access and that data cannot be intercepted."" Dr Nobles is due to speak about wireless cybercrime at the Science Museum's Dana Centre in London on Thursday.","Computer users could be tricked into believing they are visiting a legitimate website when they are really on a phishing site. A team of security experts has discovered a way to create websites that look almost identical to the real thing. It uses a standard feature of Windows XP to spoof the address bar - the part of the browser that shows the web address. The spoofed site could then trick users into giving up sensitive information. The researchers proved their technique worked by creating a phishing site that looked almost identical to PayPal. The legitimate PayPal site is protected by strong encryption so it was not vulnerable to spoofing, but the researchers said many other sites would be. The spoofing technique was developed by a team from Ruhr University in Bochum, Germany, led by Professor Stefan Winter. It works by exploiting a feature built into Windows XP called ""file name display"" which displays the name of a file in the title bar of the Windows Explorer window when the user hovers over the icon. In order for this to work, the user must have ""hide file name extensions"" turned off in Windows settings. If it is turned on, then file names appear in their full form so that users can see whether an .exe file is really a program or an executable script file. The researchers exploited this turn off option to create their spoofed website addresses. They created a typical phishing website and named all its files with names that were very similar to those used on the real PayPal website. The ""n"
tech,Home Phones Face Unclear Future,"The fixed line phone in your home could soon be an endangered species. Research by handset maker Nokia shows that more and more people are using their mobile phone for every call they make or take. According to the study, more than 45 million people in the UK, Germany, US and South Korea now only use a mobile. It showed that people keep their fixed line phone because call charges are lower, but most of those questioned said the future was definitely mobile. The Nokia-sponsored research showed that mobiles and fixed phones were used for different purposes. Home phones were used for longer calls but conversations on mobiles tended to be shorter, between mobiles and to friends. In the UK 69% of those questioned said they turned to their fixed phone because it was still cheaper to use than a mobile. However, when pressed few could say with accuracy how tariffs on fixed and mobile phones compared. In the US and Germany many of those interviewed said they used the fixed phone because it was more reliable than a mobile handset and let them get access to the net at relatively high speeds. In all the countries where interviews were carried out, older people were more likely to use a fixed line phone more than a mobile. Women aged 50 or above almost never use a mobile phone, the research found. The move to mobile was most pronounced in South Korea where 65% of those questioned said they already make most of their calls from a mobile. 18% said they would not get a landline if they moved house. Many of those questioned said they had an emotional connection to their fixed phone that drew on its position in the home and the ""cosiness"" of making a call there. Nokia said these findings had implications for mobile operators who must work hard to ensure that mobiles are seen as cheap, reliable and providing good call quality. The survey also showed that it is not just voice calls that are going wireless. Some of those questioned said they were looking to use a mobile or wireless service to get net access within the next couple of years. Polling firm Mori interviewed more than 6,000 people in the UK, US, Germany and South Korea for the survey.","UK home phone owners may not be able to use their handsets to surf the net or make video calls by 2010, experts have warned. The reason has to do with how phone lines are accessed by device makers. There are two ways of doing this - one is to buy access to the physical telephone line itself, while the other is to lease a virtual connection that allows access to the net. But the leasing option is likely to disappear when a current contract ends in 2010, according to a report produced by industry experts. This could lead to many existing services being lost, the experts warned. ""It is impossible to predict what services will remain available,"" said Andrew Ferguson of the Oxford Internet Institute, who helped compile the report. ""But we can say with some confidence that many will not,"" he said. Part of the reason for this uncertainty is that there is no clear understanding about who owns what on the UK's telephone networks. ""There's no legal framework for establishing who has rights to access and use a telephone line,"" said Mr Ferguson. This means that changes to contracts can have a huge impact on what services get offered in future. As things stand, most home phone owners get access to the net via a process known as leased line provision (LLP). This allows handset makers and net providers to pay for access on an as-needed basis and helps keep costs down for consumers. But when most current LLP contracts end in 2010, they are likely to be replaced by permanent connections, according to"
tech,Bad E-Mail Habits Sustains Spam,"The 'bad behaviour' of e-mail users is helping to sustain the spam industry, a new study has found. According to a survey conducted by security firm Mirapoint and market research company the Radicati Group, nearly a third of e-mail users have clicked on links in spam messages. One in ten users have bought products advertised in junk mail. Clicking on a link in a spam message can expose people to viruses and alert spammers to live e-mail accounts. The fact that one in ten e-mail users are buying things advertised in spam continues to make it an attractive business, especially given that sending out huge amounts of spam costs very little, the report concludes. ""This preliminary data is surprising and somewhat shocking to us,"" said Marcel Nienhuis, market analyst at the Radicati Group. ""It explains why e-mail security threats including spam, viruses and phishing scams continue to proliferate,"" he said, accusing users of ""bad e-mail behaviour"". Spammers are increasingly hooking into whatever happens to be flavour of the month, according to security firm Clearswift. It has recently seen a rise in the number of spam messages offering phoney Sony PSP giveaways. And, in perhaps a nod to the popularity of the American drama series Desperate Housewives, it has also seen a dramatic rise in junk mails purporting to give details of women looking for casual sex. But rather than finding a companion, users who click on such mail will find themselves redirected to porn sites, where they run the risk of downloading spyware on to their PC. Clearswift has seen a 180% rise in sex-related spam over the course of the last month. ""Without casting aspersions, those likely to respond to these kind of adverts will be invariably hoping that 'one thing leads to another' but aside from the fact that these mails are bogus, clicking on any link within a spam mail can lead to a whole host of unwanted problems,"" said Alyn Hockey, Clearswift's director of research. Sexually explicit terms make up 14% of security firm Sophos' top 50 word that spammers most commonly try to disguise in order to beat anti-spam filters. Spammers will deliberately misspell a word or use digits instead of letters in an attempt to by-pass anti-spam software, said Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant for security firm Sophos. ""The list of words most commonly hidden by the spammers from anti-spam software reveals that most spam is about the old favourites: money, drugs and sex,"" said Mr Cluley. But anti-spam filters can only be part of the solution to the menace of junk e-mail. ""People must resist their basic instincts to buy from spam mails. Spammers are criminals, plain and simple. If no-one responded to junk e-mail and didn't buy products sold in this way, then spam would be as extinct as the dinosaurs,"" he said.","Four in ten people regularly receive spam or junk e-mail messages but only a third of people say they are very annoyed by them. A survey of 2,000 people by anti-spam firm IronPort found that although spam is annoying, more than half of people have stopped opening e-mails from certain senders. More than a third of respondents said they had never opened a spam message and more than a quarter said they used filters to stop junk messages. But the survey also found that bad e-mail habits sustained spam, with three quarters of respondents saying they had forwarded junk mail messages to friends. The survey also showed that people were not very aware of their legal rights to stop receiving unwanted junk mail messages. More than three quarters of respondents said they did not know how to stop getting junk mail. More than half of respondents said they had not reported junk mail messages to the Office of the Information Commissioner or their Internet Service Provider (ISP). And more than a quarter said they did not know who to report junk mail messages to. ""Junk e-mail is an annoyance but it is not an epidemic,"" said Professor Alan Woodward, from the department of computing at the University of Surrey told BBC News Online. ""People are very complacent because there is not much they can do about it other than changing their e-mail address, which is a pain."" ""People need to be more proactive and learn how to use their ISP's reporting facilities,"" he added. More than half of"
tech,Domain System Scam Fear,"A system to make it easier to create website addresses using alphabets like Cyrillic could open a back door for scammers, a trade body has warned. The Internationalised Domain Names system has been a work in progress for years and has recently been approved by the Internet Electronic Task Force. But the UK Internet Forum (UKIF) is concerned that the system will let scammers create fake sites more easily. The problem lies in the computer codes used to represent language. Registering names that look like that of legitimate companies but lead users to fake sites designed to steal passwords and credit card details could become a whole lot easier for determined scammers, says Stephen Dyer, director of UKIF. Domain names are the ""real language"" addresses of websites, rather than their internet protocol address, which is a series of numbers. They are used so people can more easily navigate the web. So-called ASCII codes are used to represent European languages but for other languages a hybrid of a system called Unicode is used. So, for example, website PayPal could now be coded using a mixture of the Latin alphabet and the Russian alphabet. The resulting domain as displayed to the users would look identical to the real site as a Russian 'a' look just like an English 'a'. But the computer code would be different, and the site it would lead users to could be a fake. This is more than just a theory. A fake Paypal.com has already been registered with net domain giant Verisign by someone who has followed the debate around the Internationalised Domain Name (IDN) system, said Mr Dyer. As the idea was to prove a point rather than be malicious the fake domain has now been handed back to Paypal but it sets a worrying precedent, Mr Dyer said. ""Although the IDN problem is well known in technical circles, the commercial world is totally unaware how easily their websites can be faked,"" said Mr Dyer. ""It is important to alert users that there is a new and invisible and almost undetectable way of diverting them to what looks like a perfectly genuine site,"" he added. There are solutions. For instance, browsers could spot domains that use mixed characters and display them in different colours as a warning to users. Mr Dyer acknowledged that it would be a huge undertaking to update all the world's browsers. Another solution, to introduce IDN-disabled browsers could be a case of ""throwing out the baby with the bath water,"" he said. CENTR, the Council of European National Top Level Domain Registries, agrees. ""A rush to introduce IDN-disabled browsers into the marketplace is an overly-zealous step that will harm public confidence in IDNs - a technology that is desperately needed in the non-English speaking world,"" the organisation said in a statement.","Software firms are being urged to be wary of a scam that uses malware to hide a backdoor access program. The warning comes from security software firm Trend Micro which has found evidence that the virus is being used to create backdoors into firms' networks. The virus, known as NTDWRDR, tries to trick users into installing the backdoor by claiming that an update of Windows Media Player is available. Once installed, the backdoor gives attackers access to the network and any machines on it. The malware was spotted by Trend Micro in November and December in the US, Europe and Asia. ""The nature of this threat highlights how criminals will use any means possible to gain access to corporate resources,"" said Stephen Bennett, director of product management at Trend Micro. ""As more and more companies connect their corporate networks to the internet, they must take extra steps to protect themselves from malware and other malicious code."" The malware was found in emails sent out on a Friday or Monday suggesting that the attacker was trying to catch staff off guard when they were busy. It hides itself in a file called Mediaplayer11update.exe and once installed on a machine allows attackers to download other programs onto the network. Once on the network, it looks for shared folders and attempts to gain access if passwords have not been changed from the default values. Once it has gained access to a machine, it looks for other machines on the network and copies itself onto them too. It also looks for files which might contain passwords or other sensitive information. According"
tech,Nintendo Ds Aims To Touch Gamers,"The mobile gaming industry is set to explode in 2005 with a number of high-profile devices offering a range of gaming and other features such as movie and music playback. Market leader Nintendo, however, is releasing a handheld console that it says will revolutionise the way games are played. The first striking thing about the DS is how retro it looks. Far from looking like a mould-breaking handheld, it looks more like Nintendo dug out a mould from a 1980s handheld prototype. The lightweight clam shell device opens up to reveal two screens, and when switched on it instantly reveals its pedigree. Both screens are crisp and clear while the bottom of the two is touch sensitive. Nintendo has given developers free rein to utilise the dual screens and ability to control the action by simply touching the screen. The Japanese gaming giant hopes the DS will maintain the firm's pre-eminence in an increasingly-competitive mobile gaming market. Nintendo first launched its GameBoy console in 1989 and has dominated the market ever since. But its lead can no longer be taken for granted. Sony will enter the market later this year with its PlayStation Portable, while start-up companies Gizmondo and Tapwave Zodiac are also offering hybrid devices. ""We believe the DS will appeal to all ages, both genders and gamers of any skill,"" said David Yarnton, Nintendo Europe's general manager said at the recent press launch for the handheld. With its two screens, wireless connectivity and backwards compatibility with the GameBoy Advance, the DS certainly has a number of unique selling points. It went on sale in the US in mid-November priced $150 and Nintendo says sales have exceeded expectations, without giving detailed figures. Japan and Europe will have to wait until the first quarter of 2005 to get the device. With more than two million pre-orders for the device in Japan, Nintendo is confident it will keep its number one spot. But will the device prove to be as revolutionary as claimed? The game ships with a demo of Metroid Hunters - a 3D action title which can be played alone or with a group of friends using the machine's wireless capabilities. It certainly looks impressive on the small machine and plays smoothly even with a group of people. The game can be controlled by using the supplied stylus to aim. The top screen is used to navigate the action while the bottom screen offers a top-down map and the ability to switch weapons. It is certainly a unique control method and while it makes aiming more controlled it can be a little disorientating. Super Mario 64 DS is a faithful re-creation of the Nintendo 64 classic with a host of new mini-games and new levels. The game looks stunning on the portable machine and the sound too is impressive for such a small machine. One thing is for certain. Hardened gamers will have to learn to adapt to a new way of playing while it could prove to be an accessible way in to gaming for novices, Ultimately the success or failure of the device lies in the hands of developers. If they manage to create titles which use the Nintendo DS's key features then a whole new market of gamers could open up. The fear is that the touch screen and voice recognition are treated as little more than gimmicks.","A new handheld games console from Nintendo has been launched to take on the PlayStation Portable (PSP) and the Xbox Portable (XGP). The DS (short for Nintendo Dual Screen) aims to bring console gaming to a mass market with touch screen technology. The device features two screens, one of which acts as a touch control panel. Nintendo hopes the device will help it regain market dominance after its GameCube console failed to win gamers over. The PSP launched in 2004 and has sold more than 6.5 million units since then. Microsoft's XGP is not expected to go on sale until late 2005 at the earliest. The DS will go on sale in the US, Europe and Japan from 26 November. Nintendo president Satoru Iwata said the new device would ""change the world of handheld gaming forever"". The device has two touch screen displays, one of which is fixed while the other can be turned 90 degrees to act as a short-range stylus-based pointer. They are both controlled by a thumb-operated analogue stick on the right-hand side of the device. The screens show different images depending on how they are held, allowing players to have different viewpoints in games. The DS also features short-range wireless technology that lets up to 16 people play together in close proximity. Nintendo hopes this will encourage more social gaming, something that has been popular on consoles but less so on handheld devices. In addition, the device will play music and video, as well as using wireless links for"

A ball is flung out to winger Shane Williams who crosses to score the winning try for Wales. But the England players are incensed - arguing that the pass was forward and the try should not stand. In the past, sports fans would be left debating the validity of the try for days and weeks to come. But BBC Sport's new tool Piero could end discussions in minutes. Piero, named after the Italian painter and pioneer of perspective Piero della Francesco, creates a virtual stadium in which virtual players can be tracked from almost any angle. Viewers will be able to see precisely how the ball was thrown and by whom, giving a greater depth to the growing wealth of analysis available during sports broadcasts. The technology has been created by BBC Research and Development for BBC Broadcast and BBC Outside Broadcasts. BBC Sport is the first client to start using the system. ""In order to keep audiences growing and growing... we need to work closely with people who create technology and innovation to bring sport to life,"" said Andrew Thompson, the BBC's head of development, new media and sports news. ""We want to appeal to core fans - to give them more analysis, more detail, more definitive answers about key passages of play."" Piero works by taking telemetric data from fixed camera positions and sending that data inside the video signal to a PC which can then render the information into 3D graphics. The more cameras using Piero, the better the detail possible out the other end when the data is turned into 3D models. ""It allows us to tell the story of a passage of play, tracking individual players across the field, looking at tactics,"" said Andy Townsend, from BBC Broadcast. An operator can manipulate the information and provide almost real-time replays of incidents, as well as more in-depth analysis. The ""virtual camera"" can focus on virtually any aspect of the pitch, giving viewers an insight into action that the camera normally cannot see. Piero also provides a wealth of statistical detail - from the length of kicks, to the length of a run of an individual player and the height of a lift at any lineout. Mr Townsend said sports performance companies were already showing an interest in the technology. BBC Broadcast hopes the technology can be sold to third parties interested in using it a number of different ways - from sport broadcasting to entertainment and game shows.","Former Italy fly-half Diego Dominguez has called on the Six Nations' unions to scrap the salary cap. Dominguez, who played for Italy from 1994-2000, says the current limits on players' wages are ""untenable"". ""If you have a Ferrari and try to run it on diesel, it will not perform,"" said Dominguez, who now runs a wine business in Tuscany. ""Rugby union is a sport that needs the best players. ""I have been fortunate to have played with and against many of them, and I know what is needed to allow the sport to grow."" Dominguez was capped 37 times by Italy but his final appearance came in a 73-0 thrashing by South Africa in Johannesburg in 2000. He retired shortly afterwards and believes that many talented players are now being ignored by the authorities. ""Salary caps are a complete nonsense and I would like to see the limits removed,"" he told BBC Sport. ""The IRB (International Rugby Board) will tell you it is for financial reasons but they are wrong. ""The money they are spending on administration and committees could be used to help grow rugby union in places like South Africa, Argentina, Japan and the US. ""I am worried that we are going to lose all the talented players because they are not being given a chance to play at international level. ""I think it is a tragedy for rugby union."" Dominguez also criticised plans to cut the number"
tech,Us Cyber Security Chief Resigns,"The man making sure US computer networks are safe and secure has resigned after only a year in his post. Amit Yoran was director of the National Cyber Security Division within the US Department of Homeland Security created following the 9/11 attacks. The division was tasked with improving US defences against malicious hackers, viruses and other net-based threats. Reports suggest he left because his division was not given enough clout within the larger organisation. Mr Yoran took up his post in September 2003 and his first task was to get the Cyber Security Division up and running. The organisation had a staff of about 60 people and a budget of about $80m (£44.54m). The division was charged with thinking up and carrying out action to make US networks more impervious to attack and disruption by the viruses, worms and hack attacks that have become commonplace. In the last 12 months Mr Yoran oversaw the creation of a cyber alert system that sends out warnings about big hitting viruses and net attacks as they occur. The warnings also contained information about how firms and organisations could protect themselves against these attacks. The Cyber Security Division also audited US government networks to discover exactly what was sitting on which network. The next step was to be the creation of a scanning system to identify vulnerabilities that made federal networks and machines susceptible to attack by malicious hackers and virus writers. Mr Yoran's division was also doing work to identify the networks and machines that had been broken into by cyber criminals. Despite this success Mr Yoran left his post abruptly at the end of last week, reportedly only giving one day's notice to bosses at the Department of Homeland Security. ""Amit Yoran has been a valuable contributor on cyber security issues over the past year, and we appreciate his efforts in starting the department's cybersecurity program,"" said a Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman. Some reports have suggested that Mr Yoran felt frustrated by the lack of prominence given to work to protect against net-based threats in the wider homeland organisation. An attempt by US politicians to pass a law to promote Mr Yoran and raise the profile of his department's work is now mired in Congress.","The head of the UK's Cyber Security Agency (CSA) has resigned, the organisation has said. Richard Alderman, who is director general of the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca), quit after he was offered the top job at Soca. The CSA is an agency set up to protect UK computer systems from hackers and cyber criminals. Its chief executive Ken Jones quit on Monday, saying he wanted to spend more time with his family. The CSA said Mr Alderman's resignation would not affect its plans to tackle cyber crime, which includes plans to set up an anti-hacking unit. ""His departure will not affect the excellent work currently being carried out by the agency,"" a spokeswoman said. Mr Alderman could not immediately be contacted for comment. He has been a senior figure in the fight against crime since he was appointed as the UK's first cyber crime chief in 2000. His appointment as head of Soca was seen as a major promotion when it was announced in September 2004. He took up his post on 1 January this year. The Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) is responsible for dealing with serious crimes such as people trafficking, drug smuggling, fraud and counterfeiting. Mr Alderman was appointed chief executive of Soca after its former head, Des Mannion, stepped down following allegations that he had interfered in police investigations. Mr Alderman took over at Soca just days before the agency was granted extra powers to tackle serious and organised crime. He is"
tech,Lasers Help Bridge Network Gaps,"An Indian telecommunications firm has turned to lasers to help it overcome the problems of setting up voice and data networks in the country. Tata Teleservices is using the lasers to make the link between customers' offices and its own core network. The laser bridges work across distances up to 4km and can be set up much faster than cable connections. In 12 months the lasers have helped the firm set up networks in more than 700 locations. ""In this particular geography getting permission to dig the ground and lay the pipes is a bit of a task,"" said Mr R. Sridharan, vice president of networks at Tata. ""Heavy traffic and the layout under the ground mean that digging is uniquely difficult,"" he said. In some locations, he said, permission to dig up roads and lay cables was impossible to get. He said it was far easier to secure permission for putting networking hardware on roofs. This has led Chennai-based Tata to turn to equipment that uses lasers to make the final mile leap between Tata's core network and the premises of customers. The Lightpointe laser bridges work over distances of up to 4km and are being used to route both voice and data from businesses on to the backbone of the network. The hardware works in pairs and beam data through the air in the form of laser pulses. The laser bridges can route data at speeds up to 1.25gbps (2,000 times faster than a 512kbps broadband connection) but Tata is running its hardware at more modest speeds of 1-2mbps. The lasers are also ideal for India because of its climate. ""It's particularly suitable as the rain rate is a little low and it's hardly ever foggy,"" he said. In places where rain is heavy and fog is common laser links can struggle to maintain good connection speeds. The laser links also take far less time to set up and get working, said Mr Sridharan. ""Once we get the other permissions, normal time period for set up is a few hours,"" he said. By contrast, he said, digging up roads and laying cables can take weeks or months. This speed of set up has helped Tata with its aggressive expansion plans. Just over 12 months ago the firm had customers in only about 70 towns and cities. But by the end of March the firm hopes to reach more than 1,000. ""Speed is very important because of the pace of competition,"" said Mr Sridharan.","Overlarge distances are not a problem for laser light, which is why it is playing a big part in helping to connect countries that do not have extensive networks of copper cables. A UK company called Neul has come up with a way of using lasers to connect countries that do not have extensive networks of copper cables. By sending digital data via pulses of light, instead of an electric current, the firm has built a two-way 400Kbps link between Romania and the UK. The connection is being used to allow people in Romania to access the UK's top-level domain name, .uk, and send e-mail. But Neul is already looking at how it can use the connection to provide broadband access in Romania. ""The next step is to work out what we are going to do with this as a service,"" said Neul's chief technology officer, Phil Holloway. ""We have got to work out what people want to use it for and how we turn it into a business."" The team plans to hold a series of workshops with local Internet service providers (ISPs) in the next few weeks to work out what they want the connection for. But Mr Holloway said he was sure they would find something useful for the 100Mbps connection. ""We can provide real-time voice and video conferencing and other high-bandwidth applications like video-on-demand,"" he said. The link between Romania and the UK is one of the first in what could become a"
tech,Uk Broadband Gets Speed Injection,"Broadband's rapid rise continues apace as speeds gear up a notch. An eight megabit service has been launched by internet service provider UK Online. It is 16 times faster than the average broadband package on the market and will pave the way for services such as video-on-demand and broadband TV. The service is possible due to a new regime which allows other operators to use BT's exchanges and will initially only be available in towns. It represents a ""big leap forward"" for broadband, said Chris Stening, UK Online general manager. The service comes with a hefty £39.99 monthly price tag but will mean users can download MP3s in seconds and offers TV-quality video streaming. The service includes WiFi as standard, meaning users can connect multiple PCs, laptops and game consoles from any room in the house. Not everybody will be able to take advantage of the service, as it will be restricted to metropolitan areas. The service will initially be available to users within 2km radius of 230 telephone exchanges in areas such as London, Birmingham, Glasgow and Cambridge. That represents about 4.4 million households. The service is possible due to a decision to loosen BT's strangle-hold on telephone exchanges. The process, known as local loop unbundling, was put in motion by the now defunct telecoms watchdog Oftel but has only proved popular in recent months due to falling costs. UK Online is looking at the possibility of bundling services such as cheap net telephone calls, video-on-demand and TV by 2005 if the service proves popular. ""The service is twice as fast as any other service on offer in the UK and 16 times faster than most broadband services,"" said Mr Stening. ""It takes a big leap for broadband and we are very excited about it,"" he said. Countries such as South Korea and France have found the advantage of upping the speeds of broadband. In South Korea, video-on-demand over the net is cheaper than renting a DVD and online gaming is huge. Mr Stening believes the service will appeal to people in multi-occupancy buildings as well as easing family arguments. ""A typical family with two adults and two children is currently sharing a 512 kilobit service. This will basically give them 2 megabits each,"" he said.","BT says it is upgrading the speeds of its broadband packages for millions of customers. The UK's largest internet service provider (ISP) says it is giving users of its packages with speeds of up to 8Mb (8 megabits per second) faster upload speeds. The move will bring BT's packages into line with packages offered by rival Virgin Media, which already offers upload speeds of up to 1Mb. However, the move will not affect users of the firm's Infinity service, which offers download speeds of up to 30Mb. BT says the upgrade will take place during February and March, with users of its packages already getting superfast speeds seeing their upload speeds boosted. ""We are pleased to be able to offer our customers a significant boost in upload speeds at no extra cost,"" said Marc Townsend, managing director of consumer at BT. ""It is important that our customers feel rewarded for the investment they have made in a high-speed connection,"" he added. The move comes after Ofcom, the UK's telecoms regulator, recommended that all households should have access to a minimum speed of two megabits per second by 2012. Ofcom also said that it was considering whether a target speed for every home should be set as part of its drive to ensure that Britain's broadband needs are met. Currently, about five million UK households do not have access to even the minimum speed recommended by Ofcom. Virgin Media recently increased the speeds on two of its broadband packages, offering users"
tech,Why Cell Will Get The Hard Sell,"The world is casting its gaze on the Cell processor for the first time, but what is so important about it, and why is it so different? The backers of the processor are big names in the computer industry. IBM is one of the largest and most respected chip-makers in the world, providing cutting edge technology to large businesses. Sony will be using the chip inside its PlayStation 3 console, and its dominance of the games market means that it now has a lot of power to dictate the future of computer and gaming platforms. The technology inside the Cell is being heralded as revolutionary, from a technical standpoint. Traditional computers - whether they are household PCs or PlayStation 2s - use a single processor to carry out the calculations that run the computer. The Cell technology, on the other hand, uses multiple Cell processors linked together to run lots of calculations simultaneously. This gives it processing power an order of magnitude above its competitors. Whilst its rivals are working on similar technology, it is Sony's which is the most advanced. The speed of computer memory has been slowly increasing over the last few years, but the memory technology that accompanies the Cell is a huge leap in performance. Using a technology called XDR, created by American firm Rambus, memory can run up to eight times faster than the current standard being promoted by Intel. Perhaps more important than any of the technology is the Cell's role in the imminent ""war on living rooms"". The big trend predicted for this year is the convergence of computers with home entertainment devices such as DVD players and hi-fis. Companies like Microsoft and Sony believe that there is a lot of money to be made by putting a computer underneath the TV of every household and then offering services such as music and video downloads, as well as giving an individual access to all the media they already own in one place. Microsoft has already made its first tactical move into this area with its Windows Media Center software, which has been adopted by many PC makers. Sony had a stab at something similar with the PSX - a variation on the PlayStation - last year in Japan, although this attempt was generally seen as a failure. Both companies believe that increasing the capabilities of games consoles, to make them as powerful as PCs, will make the technology accessible enough to persuade buyers to give them pride of place on the video rack. Sony and IBM want to make sure that the dominance of the PC market enjoyed by Microsoft and Intel is not allowed to extend to this market. By creating a radically new architecture, and using that architecture in a games console that is sure to be a huge seller, they hope that the Cell processor can become the dominant technology in the living room, shutting out their rivals. Once they have established themselves under the TV, there is no doubt that they hope to use this as a base camp to extend their might into our traditional PCs and instigate a regime change on the desktop. Cell is, in fact, specifically designed to be deployed throughout the house. The links between the multiple processors can also be extended to reach Cell processors in entirely different systems. Sony hopes to put Cells in televisions, kitchen appliances and anywhere that could use any sort of computer chip. Each Cell will be linked to the others, creating a vast home network of computing power. Resources of the Cells across the house can be pooled to provide more power, and the links can also be used to enable devices to talk to each other, so that you can programme your microwave from your TV, for example. This digital home of the future depends on the widespread adoption of the Cell processor and there are, as with all things, a number of reasons it could fail. Because the processor is so different, it requires programmers to learn a different way of writing software, and it may be that the changeover is simply too difficult for them to master. You can also guarantee that Microsoft and Intel are not going to sit around and let Cell take over home computing without a fight. Microsoft is going to be pushing its Xbox 2 as hard as possible to make sure that its technology, not Sony's, will be under your tree next Christmas. Intel will be furiously working on new designs that address the problems of its current chips to create a rival technology to Cell, so that it doesn't lose its desktop PC dominance. If Cell succeeds in becoming the living room technology of choice, however, it could provide the jump-start to the fully digital home of the future. The revolution might not be televised, but it could well be played with a videogame controller.","Rory Cellan-Jones Technology reporter, BBC News The idea that broadband access should be treated as an essential service like water or electricity has been floated before. But never has the argument been spelt out so forcefully as in a speech made by the chief executive of BT on Thursday. Mike Lynch warned that unless the UK got access to superfast broadband right, it could fall behind the rest of the world. If he is right, then the government and the regulator will have to start taking a hard look at the way BT is spending its money. Because at the moment, the money it is using is your money. It has been given £1.5bn to roll out its broadband access network (BAN) and much of that cash is going into its traditional fixed line system. Instead of spending money on upgrading that system, it is spending some of its money on building up a wholesale broadband business so it can compete with the likes of Tiscali and AOL. That business has yet to turn a profit and investors are getting jumpy. The share price of the once-mighty British Telecom has been on a roller coaster ride for much of this year as investors speculate about how much money it will make from its broadband access service (BAS) offering. Meanwhile, other companies like Cable&Wireless are allowed to go ahead with their own plans to offer ultrafast broadband services so they can compete with BT when it launches its own superfast offering next summer. The trouble is that Cable"
tech,More Women Turn To Net Security,"Older people and women are increasingly taking charge of protecting home computers against malicious net attacks, according to a two-year study. The number of women buying programs to protect PCs from virus, spam and spyware attacks rose by 11.2% each year between 2002 and 2004. The study, for net security firm Preventon, shows that security messages are reaching a diversity of surfers. It is thought that 40% of those buying home net security programs are retired. For the last three years, that has gone up by an average of 13.2%. But more retired women (53%) were buying security software than retired men. The research reflects the changing stereotype and demographics of web users, as well as growing awareness of the greater risks that high-speed broadband net connections can pose to surfers. The study predicts that 40% of all home PC net security buyers will be women in 2005. They could even overtake men as the main buyers by 2007, if current rates persist, according to the research. ""I think older people have become more vigilant about protecting their PCs as we tend to be more cautious and want an insurance policy in case something does go wrong"", said one over-60 woman who took part in the research. ""You started off with young male stereotype computer users for last 10 years,"" Paul Goosens, head of Preventon told the BBC News website. ""Now we are seeing real people - both sexes and very often it is women who have more access at home."" But net service providers still need to take more responsibility in making sure people are educated about net threats before they go online, particuarly if they are new to broadband, he said. Programs also need to be tailored so that they can be installed by dial-up users with a slower connection too, said Mr Goosens. Security software should be easy to use, with simple interfaces and instructions written in non-technical language, he added. The nature of the security threats are also becoming more than just about e-mail viruses. High-profile complaints about rogue diallers, and spyware or other programs that surreptitiously install themselves on computers, have also raised awareness about the need to have a combination of anti-virus, firewall and spyware-removal programs too. Without protection, these kinds of programs can be picked up just through surfing the web normally. More than 30,000 PCs a day globally are being recruited into networks that spread spam and viruses, a study from security from Symantec showed last year. Viruses written to make headlines by infecting millions are also getting rarer, according to net security experts. Programs are being unleashed to directly profit criminal gangs, many based in Eastern Europe, over those which are designed to show off technical skills or cause nuisance. The research shows that more people are taking these criminal net threats more seriously because, said Mr Goosens, they are reported in the press much more. ""You are seeing older users being educated by the media and are seeing them picking up on this threat. They are asking the right questions,"" he explained. ""It is more likely the younger users who naively assume that because they are using a reputable service provider, that they are safe to connect to the net."" An unprotected computer on a broadband connection can be breached and infected with viruses or spyware within minutes. By the end of the year it is thought that more than 30% of UK homes will have broadband net access. In July last year, the number of UK households accessing the net via broadband surpassed those using dial-up for the first time, according to the Office of National Statistics.","More women are turning to net security firms as more of their personal information is put online, says a report from market research company NOP. The company found that women were more likely to use internet security products than men, as they were more worried about privacy. NOP surveyed 2,000 UK adults who used the net for more than an hour a week. It found that 86% of adults used the net at least once a week and 79% had visited a social networking site such as MySpace or Bebo in the past month. Almost 60% of adults said that they would not be happy if a company they did business with knew all their personal information, said NOP. However, only 44% of adults said they were aware of the implications of ""sharing"" information with other people on social networking sites. A quarter of respondents said that they had felt uneasy about what information was available about them on the web. ""The survey shows that the majority of net users are concerned about their privacy and share personal information only with people they know well,"" said Lesley Smith, senior product manager at NCS Pearson, which commissioned the research. ""But there are still huge numbers who are not fully aware of what information companies and other net users can access."" The survey found that 56% of adults said they were very or fairly confident they could keep their personal information private if they wanted to. And 48% said they were confident they could tell if someone was trying to trick them into revealing personal information"
tech,Google To Scan Famous Libraries,"The libraries of five of the world's most important academic institutions are to be digitised by Google. Scanned pages from books in the public domain will then be made available for search and reading online. The full libraries of Michigan and Stanford universities, as well as archives at Harvard, Oxford and the New York Public Library are included. Online pages from scanned books will not have adverts but will have links to online store Amazon, Google said. ""The goal of the project is to unlock the wealth of information that is offline and bring it online,"" said Susan Wojcicki, director of product management at Google. There will also be links to public libraries so that the books can be borrowed. Google will not be paid for providing for the links. It will take six years to digitise the full collection at Michigan, which contains seven million volumes. Users will only have access to extracts and bibliographies of copyrighted works. The New York library is allowing Google to include a small portion of books no longer covered by copyright. Harvard is limiting its participation to 40,000 books, while Oxford wants Google to scan books originally published in the 19th Century and held in the Bodleian Library. A spokeswoman for Oxford University said the digitised books would include novels, poetry, political tracts and art books. ""Important works that are out of print or only available in a few libraries around the world will be made available to everyone,"" she said. About one million books will be scanned by Google, less than 15% of the total collection held in the Bodleian. ""We hope that Oxford's contribution to this project will be of scholarly use, as well as general interest, to people around the world,"" said Reg Carr, director of Oxford University Library Services. ""It's a significant opportunity to bring our material to the rest of the world,"" said Paul LeClerc, president of the New York Public Library. ""It could solve an old problem: If people can't get to us, how can we get to them?"" ""This is the day the world changes,"" said John Wilkin, a University of Michigan librarian working with Google. ""It will be disruptive because some people will worry that this is the beginning of the end of libraries. ""But this is something we have to do to revitalise the profession and make it more meaningful.""","Google is to scan and index millions of books from five famous libraries. The US internet giant signed a deal with Oxford University to scan the Bodleian Library, along with the British Library and four other major European libraries. It is part of Google's efforts to build a ""virtual library"" on the net, the firm said. But critics say such projects threaten authors' rights to profit from their work. Google will digitise and index up to 30 million books from the five libraries over five years. The deal was signed in London at a meeting between Google's billionaire founder Larry Page and UK Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell. Ms Jowell told reporters: ""I'm confident that this partnership will help make the UK one of the world's great knowledge economies."" The other libraries involved are in Amsterdam, The Hague and Rotterdam in the Netherlands, Leiden in the Netherlands and Munich in Germany. ""We are very excited to be working with these amazing libraries,"" said Google's chief executive Eric Schmidt. ""They hold centuries worth of knowledge, which will now be searchable on Google."" Mr Schmidt said he hoped the project would help students worldwide find books more easily and would improve access to information for people who cannot read. He added that he did not believe the project would damage publishers' profits from book sales. The scanning process will take place in the Netherlands because of the country's favourable copyright laws. Prof Susan Gibber, pro-vice-chancellor for research at Oxford University, said:"
tech,Putting A Face To 'Big Brother',"Literally putting a face on technology could be one of the keys to improving our interaction with hi-tech gadgets. Imagine a surveillance system that also presents a virtual embodiment of a person on a screen who can react to your behaviour, and perhaps even alert you to new e-mails. Basic versions of these so-called avatars already exist. Together with speech and voice recognition systems, they could replace the keyboard and mouse in the near future. Some of these ideas have been showcased at the London's Science Museum, as part of its Future Face exhibition. One such avatar is Jeremiah. It is a virtual man, which you can download for free and install in your computer. His creator, Richard Bowden, lecturer at the Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing at the University of Surrey, refers to Jeremiah as ""him"", rather than it. ""Jeremiah is a virtual face that attempts to emulate humans in the way it responds to activity. He is very childlike, he likes visual stimulus,"" he told the BBC News website. ""When he sees children running and laughing and waving at him, he smiles at them. If you ignore him, he gets angry. If you leave, he gets sad. And you can also even surprise him."" Jeremiah is not actually intelligent. It works on vision, reacting in a preset way to the information provided by a surveillance tracker system. It is not able to talk or to hear you, at least not yet. The Surrey team is already working on Jeremiah's next version, that will replace the human face with an underwater and more interactive creature: Finn the fish. ""I am interested in the interaction, providing the ability of a system to watch what's going on and make decisions based on that,"" explained Dr Bowden. The research comes at a time when people are having to cope with an increasing number of hi-tech gadgets. Experts say a much more natural way to interact with these devices, such as a virtual human, could make it much easier to make the most of all those new gizmos. ""If you get up at three o'clock in the morning, and you go downstairs, there are probably two things you are going to do: either going to the bathroom, or maybe you are going to make a cup of tea,"" said Dr Bowden. ""Now if the system can watch your behaviour over time, it can learn this, so it would predict what you are going to do, turn on the lights for you, or, before you even get to the kettle, it could have switched it on."" You might even be able to tell your home surveillance system that you will be going away on holiday, and ask if it could make sure that the house is secure once you have left. This might sound like a scary vision of an Orwellian future. But it might all depend on the face that is watching you. ""When we put the surveillance cameras in our centre, a lot of people were very unhappy about the fact that there was a system watching them,"" said Dr Bowden. ""But when Jeremiah's camera went in, nobody minded, because although it's still watching them, they could see what it was watching.""","The 13 contestants in the second UK series of Big Brother will be officially unveiled on Friday. The group has already been selected from thousands of applicants who attended auditions over three days in London, Newcastle and Glasgow. And the first thing people will probably want to know about them is, well ... what do they look like? The producers of the show are promising that Friday's launch event ""will give viewers a chance to see the housemates in the flesh for the first time"". But the BBC's Lizo Mzimba has already met some of the hopefuls who auditioned for this year's show. He says there is a ""wide range"" of people who want to be on Big Brother, ""but producers are looking for characters who will make good TV"". He tells BBC News Online: ""There were some very weird characters who turned up. Obviously they didn't get through."" There were lots of younger people auditioning, he says, but also older people who said they wanted to appear on Big Brother because they ""thought it would be a laugh"". ""There were a lot of people who were very confident,"" he says, adding that some people had been told by their friends they would be great on Big Brother. Mr Mzimba says there were also lots of people who were just there because they had nothing better to do. He says: ""Their auditions were quite low key and not as exciting."" There were also lots of actors and performers who said they wanted to"
tech,Dozens Held Over Id Fraud Site,"Twenty-eight people, including a Briton, have been arrested after a global operation against a website allegedly involved in identity fraud. Those arrested are accused of operating Shadowcrew.com, which investigators claim was a global clearing house for criminals involved in credit card fraud. A 19-year-old man from Camberley, Surrey, was arrested by the National Hi-Tech Crime Unit but has been bailed. Operation Firewall, led by the US Secret Service, involved seven nations. The British teenager was arrested on Wednesday but details only emerged on Friday. He has now been bailed to return to a Surrey police station in December. All 28 people detained globally are suspected of being involved in an internet-based network which stole people's identities and used computers and websites to defraud credit card companies. The authorities in the US, who have indicted 19 people in Newark, New Jersey, estimate the fraud caused losses of more than $4m. Assistant US Attorney Scott Christie said several people had been arrested in Argentina, Bulgaria, Canada, Estonia, Poland and Sweden. Mr Christie said one of the ringleaders was believed to be a Russian, Anatoly Tyukanov. Investigators from 30 law enforcement agencies worldwide spent 15 months looking into the activities of three websites - Shadowcrew, Carderplanet and Darkprofits. The US Secret Service was first tipped off in July 2003. An NHTCU spokeswoman said the American investigators went undercover on the Shadowcrew website and discovered some of the site's 4,000 members were using it for organised crime purposes. She said criminals were using the websites to traffic counterfeit credit cards and false identification information and documents such as credit cards, driver's licences, passports and birth certificates. The websites shared tips on how to commit fraud and provided a forum by which people could buy the information and tools they needed to commit such crime, she said. The Shadowcrew site, which has now been taken over by the US Secret Service, listed several discussion groups, in English and Russian, including one on hacking, spam and online anonymity tools. The head of the NHTCU, Acting Detective Chief Superintendent, Mick Deats, said: ""This investigation has resulted in the significant disruption of organised criminals using the internet for profit. ""We believe that the suspects have trafficked at least 1.7 million stolen credit card numbers, leading to losses by financial institutions running into the millions."" Chief Supt Deats went on to warn: ""The internet offers huge legitimate benefits for modern society; however with it brings powerful opportunities for those seeking to abuse those benefits for criminal gain. ""Your identity is one of the most precious commodities. Criminals who try to steal the personal and financial information of ordinary citizens as well as the confidential and proprietary information of companies engaged in e-commerce, will be targeted by law enforcement.""","Dozens of people have been arrested in a crackdown on a website which gave tips on how to get a false passport and other ID documents. More than 100 officers raided 22 addresses after the UK-based site, idforever.com, was shut down in January. More than a dozen people have been charged with using the site to try and get fake documents, while more arrests are expected. Police said the site had helped organised crime networks and made it easier for terrorists to get false ID papers. The website provided advice on how to get documents such as birth and marriage certificates, driving licences and utility bills which could be used to support false identity documents. It was closed down after police asked UK internet service providers (ISPs) to close its web address. Det Supt Chris Witty, from the Serious and International Crime Unit, said: ""This website provided step-by-step instructions on how to obtain official documentation that could be used in the furtherance of criminal activity. ""It also provided advice on how to use this documentation in conjunction with other false documentation, such as passports, to open bank accounts and obtain credit cards."" The site told users how to contact corrupt officials, get hold of blank forms and then forge the documents themselves. It also gave tips on how to use scanning equipment and printers to make the finished documents look authentic. Det Supt Witty said: ""The response from the public and business community has been overwhelming and we believe that as a direct result of this action"
tech,Bt Program To Beat Dialler Scams,"BT is introducing two initiatives to help beat rogue dialler scams, which can cost dial-up net users thousands. From May, dial-up net users will be able to download free software to stop computers using numbers not on a user's ""pre-approved list"". Inadvertently downloaded by surfers, rogue diallers are programs which hijack modems and dial up a premium rate number when users log on. Thousands of UK dial-up users are believed to have been hit by the scam. Some people have faced phone bills of up to £2,000. BT's Modem Protection program will check numbers that are dialled by a computer and will block them if they have not been pre-approved, such as national and net service provider numbers. Icstis, the UK's premium rate services watchdog, said it had been looking for companies to take the lead in initiatives. ""The initiatives are very welcome,"" a spokesperson from Icstis told the BBC News website. ""We are very pleased to see they are putting into place new measures to protect consumers."" The second initiative BT announced is an early warning system which will alert BT customers if there is unusual activity on their phone bills. If a bill rises substantially above its usual daily average, or if a call is made to a suspect number, a text or voice alert will be sent to the user's landline phone. As part of the clamp-down on rogue diallers, companies must now satisfy stringent conditions, including clear terms and conditions, information about how to delete diallers and responsibility for customer refunds. Any firm running a dialler without permission can now be closed down by Icstis. The watchdog brought in the action last October following a decision to license all companies which wanted to operate legitimate premium rate dialler services. There are legitimate companies who offer services such as adult content, sports results and music downloads by charging a premium rate rather than by credit card BT said it had ploughed an enormous amount of effort into protecting people from the problem. It has already barred more than 1,000 premium rate numbers and has tried to raise public awareness about the scams. ""We now want to ensure there are even stronger safeguards for our customers, who we would urge to make use of these new options to protect themselves,"" said Gavin Patterson, group managing director for consumer the arm of BT. Both schemes have been undergoing trials in Ireland, and will be made available to 20 million BT customers from May.","Microsoft has unveiled a new anti-spam tool for Outlook users which it hopes will stop people being bombarded with junk messages. The programme is designed to identify and block e-mails sent from software known as diallers which are used to send out millions of unwanted adverts. Microsoft said it hoped the new tool would help prevent users becoming victims of scams and phishing e-mails. The diallers are often used to send out messages that try and trick users into handing over personal details. Microsoft said that the number of dialler-spam messages sent out was growing at an alarming rate. It said that the number of e-mails sent using the software had grown by 1,700% in the last six months. The company said that there were now more than 50 million diallers in operation and that they were responsible for sending out about 20% of all spam messages. Diallers work by sending messages from one computer to lots of other machines in an automated way. They are often used to send out messages advertising adult services, weight loss aids and get-rich-quick schemes. Many also try and trick users into handing over personal details such as credit card numbers, account logins and passwords. Microsoft said that the new tool was part of a strategy to help users protect themselves against such scams and phishing e-mails. The tool is built into Outlook 2003, which is due to be released in the UK in February. ""We're not trying to be"
tech,Doors Open At Biggest Gadget Fair,"Thousands of technology lovers and industry experts have gathered in Las Vegas for the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES). The fair showcases the latest technologies and gadgets that will hit the shops in the next year. About 50,000 new products will be unveiled as the show unfolds. Microsoft chief Bill Gates is to make a pre-show keynote speech on Wednesday when he is expected to announce details of the next generation Xbox. The thrust of this year's show will be on technologies which put people in charge of multimedia content so they can store, listen to, and watch what they want on devices any time, anywhere. About 120,000 people are expected to attend the trade show which stretches over more than 1.5 million square feet. Highlights will include the latest trends in digital imaging, storage technologies, thinner flat screen and high-definition TVs, wireless and portable technologies, gaming, and broadband technologies. The show also includes several speeches from key technology companies such as Intel, Microsoft, and Hewlett Packard among others. ""The story this year remains all about digital and how that is completely transforming and revolutionising products and the way people interact with them,"" Jeff Joseph, from the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) told the BBC News website. ""It is about personalisation - taking your MP3 player and creating your own playlist, taking your digital video recorder and watch what you want to watch when - you are no longer at the whim of the broadcasters."" Consumer electronics and gadgets had a phenomenal year in 2004, according to figures released by CES organisers, the CEA, on Tuesday. The gadget explosion signalled the strongest growth yet in the US in 2004. Shipments of consumer electronics rose by almost 11% between 2003 and 2004. That trend is predicted to continue, according to CEA analysts, with wholesale shipments of consumer technologies expected to grow by 11% again in 2005. The fastest-growing technologies in 2004 included blank DVD media, Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) TVs, digital video recorders (DVRs), and portable music players. ""This year we will really begin to see that come to life in what we call place shifting - so if you have your PVR [personal video recorder] in your living room, you can move that content around the house. ""Some exhibitors will be showcasing how you can take that content anywhere,"" said Mr Joseph. He said the products which will be making waves in the next year will be about the ""democratisation"" of content - devices and technologies that will give people the freedom to do more with music, video, and images. There will also be more focus on the design of technologies, following the lead that Apple's iPod made, with ease of use and good looks which appeal to a wider range of people a key concern. The CEA predicted that there would be several key technology trends to watch in the coming year. Gaming would continue to thrive, especially on mobile devices, and would reach out to more diverse gamers such as women. Games consoles sales have been declining, but the launch of next generation consoles, such as Microsoft's Xbox and PlayStation, could buoy up sales. Although it has been widely predicted that Mr Gates would be showcasing the new Xbox, some media reports have cast doubt on what he would be talking about in the keynote. Some have suggested the announcement may take place at the Games Developers Conference in the summer instead. With more than 52% of US homes expected to have home networks, the CEA suggested hard drive boxes - or media servers - capable of storing thousands of images, video and audio files to be accessed through other devices around the home, will be more commonplace. Portable devices that combine mobile telephony, digital music and video players, will also be more popular in 2005. Their popularity will be driven by more multimedia content and services which will let people watch and listen to films, TV, and audio wherever they are. This means more storage technologies will be in demand, such as external hard drives, and flash memory like SD cards. CES runs officially from 6 to 9 January.","Britain's biggest consumer electronics and gadget show opens its doors to the public on Saturday. The three-day Electronica consumer electronics show at the NEC in Birmingham has 300 exhibitors. The show provides a platform for manufacturers to show off their latest products and get feedback from consumers. There is expected to be a strong focus on digital home entertainment at this year's show. The Electronica show is part of the Gadget Show Live exhibition which also includes a number of other attractions, a car show and a water park. ""The show gives manufacturers a fantastic opportunity to get their products in front of the public, get some real-world feedback, and also lets them know what consumers are looking for in the future,"" said Martin Ashurst, editor of What Mobile magazine and one of the event's judges. ""There is also an enormous amount of competition between manufacturers to really wow the crowds at these shows and get the attention of the media, so it is a very important marketing tool for them."" The latest offerings from Sony, Samsung, Sharp, Philips and Panasonic will be on display at Electronica alongside new digital video recorders (DVDs), digital video players and televisions. The organisers expect more than 200,000 visitors will pass through the doors during the three-day show. There is also expected to be a strong focus on new technologies such as high-speed wireless internet access and networking. In particular, there should be plenty of interest in new portable media players (PMPs) such"
tech,Hitachi Unveils 'Fastest Robot',"Japanese electronics firm Hitachi has unveiled its first humanoid robot, called Emiew, to challenge Honda's Asimo and Sony's Qrio robots. Hitachi said the 1.3m (4.2ft) Emiew was the world's quickest-moving robot yet. Two wheel-based Emiews, Pal and Chum, introduced themselves to reporters at a press conference in Japan. The robots will be guests at the World Expo later this month. Sony and Honda have both built sophisticated robots to show off developments in electronics. Explaining why Hitachi's Emiew used wheels instead of feet, Toshihiko Horiuchi, from Hitachi's Mechanical Engineering Research Laboratory, said: ""We aimed to create a robot that could live and co-exist with people."" ""We want to make the robots useful for people ... If the robots moved slower than people, users would be frustrated."" Emiew - Excellent Mobility and Interactive Existence as Workmate - can move at 3.7m/h. Its ""wheel feet"" resemble the bottom half of a Segway scooter. With sensors on the head, waist, and near the wheels, Pal and Chum demonstrated how they could react to commands. ""I want to be able to walk about in places like Shinjuku and Shibuya [shopping districts] in the future without bumping into people and cars,"" Pal told reporters. Hitachi said Pal and Chum, which have a vocabulary of about 100 words, could be ""trained"" for practical office and factory use in as little as five to six years. Robotics researchers have long been challenged by developing robots that walk in the gait of a human. At the recent AAAS (American Association for the Advancement of Science) annual meeting in Washington DC, researchers showed off bipedal designs. The three designs, each built by a different research group, use the same principle to achieve a human-like gait. Sony and Honda have both used humanoid robots, which are not commercially available, as a way of showing off computing power and engineering expertise. Honda's Asimo was ""born"" five years ago. Since then, Honda and Sony's Qrio have tried to trump each other with what the robots can do at various technology events. Asimo, has visited the UK, Germany, the Czech Republic, France and Ireland as part of a world tour. Sony's Qrio has been singing, jogging and dancing in formation around the world too and was, until last year, the fastest robot on two legs. But its record was beaten by Asimo. It is capable of 3km/h, which its makers claim is almost four times as fast as Qrio. Last year, car maker Toyota also stepped into the ring and unveiled its trumpet-playing humanoid robot. By 2007, it is predicted that there will be almost 2.5 million ""entertainment and leisure"" robots in homes, compared to about 137,000 currently, according to the United Nations (UN). By the end of that year, 4.1 million robots will be doing jobs in homes, said the report by the UN Economic Commission for Europe and the International Federation of Robotics. Hitachi is one of the companies with home cleaning robot machines on the market.","Japanese electronics giant Hitachi has unveiled what it says is the world's fastest industrial robot. The six-axis machine, which can move at a speed of 5.5 metres per second, is designed to improve the efficiency of assembly lines. The firm says the robot will help firms cut labour costs and improve the quality of products. However, critics say the machines could cost millions of pounds and would be too inflexible to be useful in most manufacturing environments. For example, the robot unveiled by Hitachi on Wednesday could only be used to handle a cylindrical object about 30cm (1ft) long. The robot uses laser, video and touch sensors to measure the shape, surface texture and weight of objects it picks up. It can then calculate the best way to move them so as to avoid dropping them or damaging them in transit. Hitachi said the robot would be able to identify an object within about 100 milliseconds, before moving it within one second. ""This robot will transform factory automation,"" said Hideaki Kawashima, general manager of Hitachi's automation systems division. ""It will make operations much simpler, much safer and more efficient."" He added that the machine would cut the time needed to assemble a car door from five minutes with human workers to 20 seconds with the new robot. ""That not only improves productivity but also improves quality - human beings make mistakes,"" he said. At present, only a handful of companies have bought robots like this one - although Hitachi said it"
tech,Musical Future For Phones,"Analyst Bill Thompson has seen the future and it is in his son's hands. I bought my son Max a 3G phone, partly because they are so cheap and he needed a phone, and partly because I am supposed to know about the latest technology and thought I should see how they work in real life. After using it for a while I am not at all tempted to get rid of my SonyEricsson P800 smart phone. That has a relatively large screen, even if it does only have slower GPRS access to the network. I can read my e-mail, surf the web using a proper browser and write stuff using the stylus on its touch screen. Last week someone e-mailed me a document that had been compressed into a ZIP file, and I was pleasantly surprised to discover that my phone even knew how to decompress it for me. By contrast the confusing menus, complicated keyboard and truly irritating user interface of Max's 3G phone simply get in the way, and I did not see much value in the paid-for services, especially the limited web access. The videos of entertainment news, horoscopes and the latest celebrity gossip did not appeal, and I did not see how the small screen could be useful for any sort of image, never mind micro-TV. But then Max started playing, and I realised I was missing the point entirely. It is certainly not a great overall experience, but that is largely due to the poor menu system and the phone layout: the video content itself is compelling. The quality was at least as good as the video streaming from the BBC website, and the image is about the same size. Max was completely captivated, and I was intrigued to discover that I had nearly missed the next stage of the network revolution. It is easy to be dismissive of small screens, and indeed anyone of my generation, with failing eyesight and the view that 'there's never anything worth watching on TV', is hardly going to embrace these phones. But just as the World Wide Web was the ""killer application"" that drove internet adoption, music videos are going to drive 3G adoption. With Vodafone now pushing its own 3G service, and 3 already established in the UK, video on the phone is clearly going to become a must-have for kids sitting on the school bus, adults waiting outside clubs and anyone who has time to kill and a group of friends to impress. This will please the network operators, who are looking for some revenue from their expensively acquired 3G licences. But it goes deeper than that: playing music videos on a phone marks the beginning of a move away from the 'download and play' model we have all accepted for our iPods and MP3 players. After all, why should I want to carry 60GB of music and pictures around with me in my pocket when I can simply listen to anything I want, whenever I want, streamed to my phone? Oh - and of course you can always use the phone to make voice calls and send texts, something which ensures that it is always in someone's pocket or handbag, available for other uses too. I have never really approved of using the Internet Protocol (IP), to do either audio or video streaming, and I think that technically it is a disaster to make phone calls over the net using ""voice over IP"". But I have to acknowledge that the net, at least here in the developed Western countries, is fast and reliable enough to do both. I stream radio to my computer while I work, and enjoy hearing the bizarre stations from around the world that I can find online but nowhere else. I am even playing with internet telephony, despite my reservations, and I appear on Go Digital on the World Service, streamed over the web each week. But 3G networks have been designed to do this sort of streaming, both for voice and video, which gives them an edge over net-based IP services. The 3G services aren't quite there yet, and there is a lot to be sorted out when it comes to web access and data charges. Vodafone will let you access its services on Vodafone Live! as part of your subscription cost but it makes you pay by the megabyte to download from other sites - this one, for example. This will not matter to business users, but will distort the consumer market and keep people within the phone company's collection of partner sites, something that should perhaps be worrying telecoms regulator Ofcom. But we should not see these new phones simply as cut-down network terminals. If I want fast access to my e-mail I can get a 3G card for my laptop or hook up to a wireless network. The phone is a lot more, and it is as a combination of mini-TV, personal communications device and music/video player that it really works. There is certainly room in the technology ecosystem for many different sorts of devices, accessing a wide range of services over different networks. 3G phones and iPods can co-exist, at least for a while, but if I had to bet on the long term I would go for content on demand over carrying gigabytes in my pocket. Or perhaps some enterprising manufacturer will offer me both. An MP3G player, anyone? Bill Thompson is a regular commentator on the BBC World Service programme Go Digital.","Music fans could soon be using their mobile phones to download tracks over the net. A company called Muxtape has developed a way to let people use their phones as portable music players. The San Francisco-based start-up has developed a way to stream music over the internet, so people can listen to songs stored on their computers. Muxtape already has a deal with music site MTV and is planning to sign up more big names. The start-up has also attracted the backing of venture capitalists, winning $2.5m (£1.3m) in funding in November 2004. Muxtape's service works by letting people use any web browser to control music stored on their computer - and any file format will work. ""It's very important that if you have a file on your computer it always works,"" said Tod Cohen, chief executive of Muxtape. ""If you have an iPod and you plug it into a PC there are lots of limits on what you can do with it."" Mr Cohen said the service was about providing a ""personal jukebox for the internet age"". He said it was also about making music social too, with people able to set up playlists and share them with friends - all from their phone. ""You can take all your music wherever you go,"" he said, adding that he saw Muxtape as one part of an end-to-end solution for mobile music lovers.

tech,Napster Offers Rented Music To Go,"Music downloading, for those that have rejected the free peer to peer services, can be a costly business. The cost of paying even as little as 70p per track can add up, particularly for those people who own one of the new generation of players that can store thousands of songs. Paying per track for music is becoming as outmoded as paying per minute for internet access and alternative monthly or yearly subscription models are springing up as a more convenient, and ultimately cheaper way of owning music. ""Music fans are moving away from buying the traditional bundled package of a dozen or more songs that we used to call an album to newer ways that fit their lifestyle; either single tracks or subscriptions services,"" said Paul Myers, chief executive of Wippit, a UK-based music download service. While iTunes is doing good business with its sales of individual tracks to iPod owners, others are questioning whether the concept of owning music is even valid in the digital age. Napster is due to launch a new rental subscription service - dubbed Napster to Go in the UK in the next few months. The service can be used on players that support Microsoft Windows latest Digital Rights Management technology known as Janus. This includes players made by Samsung, Rio and Creative. Currently on offer in beta-version in the US, the service costs $15 per month for unlimited downloads. The technology ensures that music downloaded to the player only remains playable while the user subscribes to the service. Users need to update their license on a monthly basis or the tunes will no longer play. This has outraged some digital music lovers, especially as Napster already offers a cheaper service for downloading music to the PC. Napster claims the higher price is a result of record labels charging more for the to-go service and says it also offers ""greater value"" for customers. Mr Myers is not convinced a rental model will work for consumers. ""We've been offering our unlimited music subscription service for more than three years now and our customers know what they want. Format interoperability, excellent value and the reassurance that music purchased from Wippit is theirs to keep and enjoy on whatever device they choose,"" he said. ""Who wants to download a track that won't play next month if you decide to unsubscribe to the service or change portable player for an iPod or the latest mobile phone?"" Wippit offers a download subscription service for £4.99 per month or £50 per year. It has a catalogue of around 60,000 songs.","Online music service Napster has launched a new service that lets people download and keep whole albums for limited periods. The short-term music rental service lets consumers download and keep albums for periods of up to 28 days. They can then choose to download another album, or simply delete the music at the end of the rental period. The service costs about $4 (£2.50) per album, with a cap of $15 a month. Napster hopes the move will boost its profile and help it become profitable. The service is a further step along the path that Napster has been following since it closed down its unlicensed file-sharing service last year. It wants to become a legitimate online music store that serves consumers' desire to own music, but also their desire to fill gaps in their collections with limited amounts of music. The new service works in much the same way as the old Napster did, except that now the tracks users download are not permanent, but are rented rather than owned. Currently only about 20% of online music users actually pay for tracks they download. The new service is designed to tempt some of those freeloaders into paying for what they listen to - and also to entice them to try out new bands or genres, because they can try out an album for a month before deciding whether or not to keep it permanently. ""Napster 2.0 is about providing consumers with a legal alternative to piracy,"" said Napster chief executive Chris Gorham. ""It's"
tech,What'S Next For Next-Gen Consoles?,"The next generation of video games consoles are in development but what will the new machines mean for games firms and consumers? We may not know when they will be released, what they will be called or even what they will be able to do but one thing is certain - they are coming. Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo are all expected to release new machines in the next 18 months. The details of PlayStation 3, Xbox 2 (codename Xenon) and Nintendo's so-called Revolution are still to be finalised but developers are having to work on titles for the new machines regardless. ""We know maybe what the PS3 will do, but we can only guess,"" said Rory Armes, studio general manager for video game giant Electronic Arts in Europe. ""It's a horrendous effort in the first year,"" he admitted. Microsoft had delivered development kits to EA, said Mr Armes, but he said the company was still waiting on Sony and Nintendo to send kits. Although the details may not be nailed down, Mr Armes said EA was beginning to get a sense of the capabilities of the new machines. ""The rumours are that PlayStation 3 will have a little more under the hood [than Xbox 2],"" he said. ""Microsoft is obviously a software company first and foremost, while Sony has more experience in hardware. I think Sony will be able to push more into a box at cost."" What is certain is that the new machines will provide great leaps in processing and graphical power. It is also likely that they will contain convergence technologies to make the machines more of an entertainment hub. At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas Microsoft boss Bill Gates said Xbox 2 would be part of his vision of the digital lifestyle. While short on detail, he painted a picture of a machine that would complement a PC and offer ""great video gaming but video gaming for a broader set of people, more communications, more media, more connectivity"". Sony is thought to have a similar vision for PS3 while Nintendo remain focused on a machine purely for games. Until it is clear precisely what the new machines can do, developers are working on a first round of titles to harness the new horsepower. Gary Dunn, development director at Codemasters, said the company had a central technology group which was at the forefront of preparing for the next generation of consoles. ""We are working on new libraries of effects. A lot of the major techniques are already out there and in use in PC gaming, such as pixel shaders and normal mapping."" Mr Dunn said he expected the introduction of real-world physics to be a major part of the new consoles. ""We want to increase that level of immersion and realism in gaming to people can lose themselves in a game."" In the first year at least, developers said gamers should not expect games which harness the full potential of the machines. Graphical spit and polish and better physics in line with the capabilities of current high-end graphics cards for PCs should be expected. Simon Gardner, president of Climax's Action Studio, said: ""It's definitely an exciting time. We want to give more freedom to the player. We want to give players an emotional connection to the characters they play. ""The environments will be much more believable and dramatic, growing and changing as you play. ""There will be a breadth of effects, more involving worlds to play in. ""It's a bit like being an artist and being given a bigger canvas and a smaller brush. We're being given more tools. ""For the average consumer, we can get things of a more filmic quality."" Gerhard Florin, head of EA in Europe, said gamers should expect titles that blur the line between films and video games. Many will be sceptical - gamers were given similar predictions during the last transition of console hardware - but this time it would seem to be more likely. ""PS3 will provide graphics indistinguishable from movies,"" said Mr Florin. He said the distribution method for games would also change radically in the next round of consoles. ""A gamer could buy a starter disc for 10 euros. When he goes home he goes online and he could buy AI and levels as you go. ""It's much smarter if you can get levels as you go."" Mr Armes warned that developers still had to learn how to tell stories effectively in the medium. ""In some ways we are trying to forget about the hardware, go in the opposite direction. We have been very bad at letting technology design our creativity. ""What we have to do as a company is start ignoring the technology and learning our craft in telling stories."" Mr Gardner agreed: ""We can thrown more polygons around and have better AI but if it doesn't make for a better game then that's not very useful."" Developers will certainly have the tools with the new machines, but how they employ them is still to be decided.","Next-generation game consoles are expected to hit the shops over the next year or so, but what exactly is going to make them different from the current crop of machines? A lot of questions remain about how the next wave of machines will shape up, but one thing is for sure - they will have to add something special to pep up the current console market. The sales figures for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 have been a little disappointing during the last six months. Some analysts claim that the console market as a whole has peaked, and that the growth in sales over the past few years was fuelled by pent-up demand for games machines that had been delayed for a number of years. As such, it is unlikely that this downturn in sales will be reversed by the arrival of new consoles. But what are the changes that are likely to appear in the next generation? One thing that almost certainly won't happen is a shift to completely new game engines. It is unlikely that any of the three most likely contenders to be next-gen consoles will want to spend months developing a completely new set of tools and technology just so they can offer slightly prettier versions of current games. They might want to offer prettier versions of current games, of course, but they will also want to offer something more. One thing that might help boost sales is simply offering more storage space for gamers' saved games, music and video files. The current generation of consoles has offered a minimum storage capacity of between 16MB and 32"
tech,Apple Unveils Low-Cost 'Mac Mini',"Apple has unveiled a new, low-cost Macintosh computer for the masses, billed as the Mac mini. Chief executive Steve Jobs showed off the new machine at his annual MacWorld speech, in San Francisco. The $499 Macintosh, sold for £339 in the UK, was described by Jobs as the ""most important Mac"" made by Apple. Mr Jobs also unveiled the iPod shuffle, a new music player using cheaper flash memory rather than hard drives, which are used in more expensive iPods. The new computer shifts the company into new territory - traditionally, the firm is known as a design and innovation-led firm rather than as a mass-market manufacturer. The Mac mini comes without a monitor, keyboard and mouse, and a second version with a larger hard drive will also be sold for $599. The machine - which will be available from 22 January - was described by Jobs as ""BYODKM... bring your own display, keyboard, and mouse"". In an attempt to win over Windows PC customers, Mr Jobs said it would appeal to people thinking of changing operating systems. ""People who are thinking of switching will have no more excuses,"" he said. ""It's the newest and most affordable Mac ever."" The new computer has been the subject of speculation for several weeks and while few people will be surprised by the announcement many analysts had already said it was a sensible move. In January, Apple sued a website after it published what it said were specifications for the new computer. Ian Harris, deputy editor of UK magazine Mac Format, said the machine would appeal to PC-owning consumers who had purchased an iPod. ""They want a further taste of Mac because they like what they have seen with iPod."" Harris added: ""Everybody thought that Apple was happy to remain a niche maker of luxury computers, and moving into a market dominated by low margin manufacturers like Dell is a bold move. ""But it shows that Apple is keen to capitalise on the mass market success it's had with the iPod. The Mac mini will appeal to PC users looking for an attractive, 'no fuss' computer."" The new iPod shuffle comes in two versions - one offering 512mb of storage for $99 (£69 in the Uk) and a second with one gigabyte of storage for $149 (£99) - and went on sale Tuesday. The music player has no display and will play songs either consecutively or shuffled. The smaller iPod will hold about 120 songs, said Mr Jobs. Mr Jobs told the delegates at MacWorld that iPod already had a 65% market share of all digital music players.","Apple has launched a new version of its Mac Mini computer which is aimed at consumers. It is a smaller version of the firm's main desktop computer, with a more compact design and more powerful components. The Mac Mini costs $599 (£321) but does not include a monitor, keyboard or mouse, which pushes the total cost up to $849 (£460). It is also more powerful than Microsoft's Xbox computer. The new model has a 1.8GHz processor and a 100GB hard drive. ""Apple has once again reshaped the desktop PC market,"" said Charles Arthur, editor of the technology news website The Next Platform. He said the Mac Mini was ""a very powerful computer for the price"" and compared it to Microsoft's ZXDS project which is intended to offer an alternative to the Xbox games console. ""It's interesting that Apple is going after this market with such a powerful machine,"" Mr Arthur told BBC News. The new Mac Mini is also the latest incarnation of what was the first of Apple's computers to be offered without a monitor, keyboard or mouse, in an attempt to drive up sales. It follows in the footsteps of the iMac which was introduced in 1998 and has since been updated twice. Apple has taken on board some of the recent design trends with its new machine, which has an aluminium case as opposed to plastic. The Mac Mini can be controlled remotely via a broadband or wi-fi connection, and can also function as a server - allowing other computers to"
tech,Online Commons To Spark Debate,"Online communities set up by the UK government could encourage public debate and build trust, says the Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR). Existing services such as eBay could provide a good blueprint for such services, says the think-tank. Although the net is becoming part of local and central government, its potential has not yet been fully exploited to create an online ""commons"" for public debate. In its report, Is Online Community A Policy Tool?, the IPPR also asks if ID cards could help create safer online communities. Adopting an eBay-type model would let communities create their own markets for skills and services and help foster a sense of local identity and connection. ""What we are proposing is a civic commons,"" Will Davies, senior research fellow at the IPPR told the BBC News website. ""A single publicly funded and run online community in which citizens can have a single place to go where you can go to engage in diversity and in a way that might have a policy implication - like a pre-legislation discussion."" The idea of a ""civic commons"" was originally proposed by Stephen Coleman, professor of e-democracy at the Oxford Internet Institute. The IPPR report points to informal, small scale examples of such commons that already exist. It mentions good-practice public initiatives like the BBC's iCan project which connects people locally and nationally who want to take action around important issues. But he adds, government could play a bigger role in setting up systems of trust for online communities too. Proposals for ID cards, for instance, could also be widened to see if they could be used online. They could provide the basis for a secure authentication system which could have value for peer-to-peer interaction online. ""At the moment they have been presented as a way for government to keep tabs on people and ensuring access to public services,"" said Mr Davies. ""But what has not been explored is how authentication technology may potentially play a role in decentralised online communities."" The key idea to take from systems such as eBay and other online communities is letting members rate each other's reputation by how they treat other members. Using a similar mechanism, trust and cooperation between members of virtual and physical communities could be built. This could mean a civic commons would work within a non-market system which lets people who may disagree with one another interact within publicly-recognised rules. E-government initiatives over the last decade have very much been about putting basic information and service guides online as well as letting people interact with government via the web. Many online communities, such as chatrooms, mailing lists, community portals, message boards and weblogs often form around common interests or issues. With 53% of UK households now with access to the net, the government, suggests Mr Davies, could act as an intermediary or ""middleman"" to set up public online places of debate and exchange to encourage more ""cosmopolitan politics"" and public trust in policy. ""Government already plays a critical role in helping citizens trade with each other online. ""But it should also play a role in helping citizens connect to one another in civic, non-market interactions,"" said Mr Davies. There is a role for public bodies like the BBC, libraries, and government to bring people back into public debate again instead of millions of ""cliques"" talking to each other, he added. The paper is part of the IPPR's Digital Society initiative which is producing a number of conferences and research papers leading up to the publication of A Manifesto For A Digital Britain.","The future of the internet and online activity is going to be debated by MPs on Thursday as part of a Westminster inquiry into e-commerce. The Commons Business Innovation and Skills committee meeting will also look at legal issues and how the media is adapting to the web. The government has already pledged to bring in tough new laws governing net users. A public consultation on how the internet should be regulated in the UK closed earlier this month. A report from the committee will be published in June. The meeting comes just days after a US presidential panel recommended that all net users should be required to show their real names when signing up for websites. The Bush administration is also mulling over how best to regulate the internet and has said it will decide how it will tackle the issue by summer. The issue of online regulation is set to dominate the Westminster debate on Thursday. The e-commerce meeting is being chaired by Labour MP Adrian Bailey, who said that it was vital to have an informed opinion before any decisions were made in the UK. ""The government's Green Paper on online identity provided an important opportunity for MPs to voice their opinions,"" he said. ""It is vital that before any legislation is proposed, MPs get a chance to debate issues such as privacy, security and consumer protection."" The government's Green Paper on online identity called for views on proposals for a ""universal access"" system that would allow people to use one name and password for all websites. It also asked for suggestions about how best to protect children from harmful"
tech,Cebit Fever Takes Over Hanover,"Thousands of products and tens of thousands of visitors make Cebit the place to be for technology lovers. ""Welcome to CeBit 2005"" was the message from the pilot as we landed, the message on flyers at the airport, and the message on just about every billboard in town. CeBit fever has taken over Hanover. Hotels have been booked out for months; local people are letting out rooms in their homes to the hoards of exhibitors, visitors, and journalists. CeBit itself is huge, the exhibition site could almost be classified as a town in its own right. There are restaurants, shops, and a bus service between the halls - of which there are 27. There are more than 6,000 companies here, showing their latest products. The list of them that I was given when I came in is the size and weight of a phone book. One of the mains themes this year is the digital home, and one of the key buzzwords is convergence. The ""entertainment PC"" is being billed as the replacement for DVD players, stereos, telephones and computers - offering a one-box solution, wirelessly connected throughout a house. To show them off, one display has been modelled as a prototype ""digital lifestyle home"" by German magazine Computer Reseller News. ""We wanted to show how this fits into a living room or workplace, to give people a feeling how it would work in their homes,"" said Claudia Neulling from the magazine. The house has webcams for security in each room, which can be called up on the high definition TV, connected to the PC in the living room. That PC provides home entertainment, movies or music. It can also be linked to the car parked outside, which is kitted out with a processor of its own, along with a DVD player and cordless headphones for the kids in the back. ""Convergence for me is about how technology, the transfer of data, can do things that make it easier and more convenient for me as a consumer,"" said Mark Brailey, director of corporate marketing for Intel. ""The real challenge is to show people it's easier than they think, and fun."" He firmly believes that entertainment PCs are the future, but says they have to get past people's fears of frequent crashes and incompatibilities. That is something Microsoft is trying to do too - its stand has computers running Windows XP Media Centre edition 2005 for people to try out. Mobile phones do not escape the convergence theme. Samsung is showing off its SGH-i300, a handset with a three gigabyte hard drive, that can be used to watch compressed video or as an MP3 player. And if you would rather watch live TV than a downloaded movie NEC is showing a phone, on sale in China, which can show analogue TV on its colour screen. ""I think the most probable application is at somewhere like the train station - if you want to check the status of the soccer game for example"" said Koji Umemoto, manager of mobile terminals marketing for NEC. He admitted that the signal quality is not very good if you are on the move, and they do not have plans to launch it in Europe at the moment. Nokia was happy to demonstrate its 6230i, an upgrade to the very popular 6230. It now has a 1.3 megapixel camera, and a music player that can handle multiple formats, rather than just MP3s. It is also compatible with Nokia's new Visual Radio technology. The handset can receive FM broadcasts, and the user can interact with compatible broadcasts using a GPRS connection, to take part in competitions or get extra information such as the name of the song playing. Most companies are reluctant to show prototypes, preferring to display products that are already on sale, or just about to hit the market. Portable media player firm Creative showed off a new wireless technology, based on magnetic inductance rather than radio - a system some hearing aids use. ""The benefits over conventional Bluetooth are the lack of interference, and longer battery life,"" said Riccardo de Rinaldini, Creative's European marketing manager. The firm has a prototype headset linked up to a Zen Micro player. The transmitter on the player creates a private, magnetic ""bubble"" around the user, which is picked up by the headset. The range is only about one metre so it is only suitable for personal use. A single AAA battery is said to last up to 30 hours. Creative expects it to hit the market in its final form later this year. Even clothing is likely to be part of the convergence trend. Adidas has a trainer which, according to Susanne Risse from the company, can ""sense, understand, and adapt to your running style"". It has a battery, processor, and motor embedded in the sole. Buttons on the side allow you to set the amount of cushioning you would like by adjusting the tension on a cable running through the heel. The processor then monitors the surface you are running on, and adjusts the tension accordingly. It is being billed as ""the world's first intelligent shoe"".","The annual CeBIT technology fair in Hanover is traditionally the place where the latest consumer gadgetry is unveiled for the first time. This year is no exception and the gadgetry on show is expected to be eye-catching and innovative. BBC News went to CeBIT with a group of technology and science bloggers to find out what will be making its debut. Here are some of the highlights that caught our eye. One of the most eagerly anticipated new products is the Nokia N800 tablet computer. It is Nokia's first product to run on the open-source Linux operating system, and it has been in development for three years. The N800 has a colour screen, a full-sized keyboard and can connect to the internet via wi-fi and Bluetooth. For example, it can be used as a remote control for a hi-fi or a television. The tablet computer can also act as a bridge between a desktop computer and the internet, allowing it to be used as a second monitor. As well as being able to access websites, it can also run programmes such as OpenOffice, which mimics Microsoft Office. ""The N800 could potentially be an important platform for lots of developers,"" said Andrew 'bunty' Allen from gadget website Pocketlint. He said that it was important for Nokia to come up with something that made the company different from other mobile phone manufacturers. The N800 should be available in Europe by late April or early May, but will not be sold in the US"
tech,Mobile Games Come Of Age,"The BBC News website takes a look at how games on mobile phones are maturing. A brief round-up follows but you can skip straight to the reviews by clicking on the links below. If you think of Snake when some mentions ""mobile games"" then you could be in for a bit of a surprise. This is because mobile games have come a long way in a very short time. Even before Nokia's N-Gage game phone launched in late 2003, many mobile operators were realising that there was an audience looking for something to play on their handset. And given that many more people own handsets than own portable game playing gadgets such as the GameBoy it could be a very lucrative market. That audience includes commuters wanting something to fill their time on the way home, game fans looking for a bit of variety and hard core gamers who like to play every moment they can. Life for all these types of player has got immeasurably better in the last year as the numbers of titles you can download to your phone has snowballed. Now sites such as Wireless Gaming Review list more than 200 different titles for some UK networks and the ranges suit every possible taste. There are ports of PC and arcade classics such as Space Invaders, Lunar Lander and Bejewelled. There are also versions of titles, such as Colin McRae Rally, that you typically find on PCs and consoles. There are shoot-em-ups, adventure games, strategy titles and many novel games only found on handsets. Rarely now does an action movie launch without a mobile game tie-in. Increasingly such launches are all part of the promotional campaign for a film, understandable when you realise that a good game can rack up millions of downloads. The returns can be pretty good when you consider that some games cost £5. What has also helped games on mobiles thrive is the fact that it is easier than ever to get hold of them thanks to technology known as Wap push. By sending a text message to a game maker you can have the title downloaded to your handset. Far better than having to navigate through the menus of most mobile operator portals. The number of handsets that can play games has grown hugely too. Almost half of all phones now have Java onboard meaning that they can play the increasingly sophisticated games that are available - even the ones that use 3D graphics. The minimum technology specifications that phones should adhere to are getting more sophisticated which means that games are too. Now double key presses are possible making familiar tactics such as moving and strafing a real option. The processing power on handsets means that physics on mobile games is getting more convincing and the graphics are improving too. Some game makers are also starting to take advantage of the extra capabilities in a mobile. Many titles, particularly racing games, let you upload your best time to see how you compare to others. Usually you can get hold of their best time and race against a ""ghost"" or ""shadow"" to see if you can beat them. A few games also let you take on people in real time via the network or, if you are sitting close to them, via Bluetooth short-range radio technology. With so much going on it is hard to do justice to the sheer diversity of what is happening. But these two features should help point you in the direction of the game makers and give you an idea of where to look and how to get playing. TOO FAST TOO FURIOUS (DIGITAL BRIDGES) As soon as I start playing this I remember why I never play driving games - because I'm rubbish at them. No matter if I drive the car via joystick or keypad I just cannot get the hang of braking for corners or timing a rush to pass other drivers. The game rewards replay because to advance you have to complete every section within a time limit. Winning gives you cash for upgrades. Graphically the rolling road is a convincing enough evocation of speed as the palm trees and cactus whip by and the city scrolls past in the background. The cars handle pretty well despite my uselessness but it was not clear if the different models of cars were appreciably different on the track. The only niggle was that the interface was a bit confusing especially when using a joystick rather than the keypad to play. FATAL FORCE (MACROSPACE) A futuristic shooter that lets you either play various deathmatch modes against your phone or run through a series of scenarios that involves killing aliens invading Earth. Graphics are a bit cartoon-like but only helps to make clear what is going on and levels are well laid out and encourage you to leap about exploring. Both background music and sounds effects work well. The scenarios are well scripted and you regularly get hints from the Fatal Force commanders. Weapons include flamethrowers, rocket launchers, grenades and at a couple of points you even get chance to use a mech for a short while. With the right power-up you can go into a Matrix-style bullet time to cope with the onslaught of aliens. The game lets you play via Bluetooth if others are in range. Online the game has quite a following with clans, player rankings and even new downloadable maps.","UK-based developers are producing some of the most innovative mobile phone games, according to a survey. The report, from analyst firm Screen Digest, said the UK had produced more ""innovative"" games than any other country. The study rated games on their graphics, control and originality, with UK developers holding the top four places. Mobile phone gaming is growing in popularity and firms are cashing in on growing sales of handsets. More than 23 million mobiles were sold across Europe in 2004, according to Screen Digest's figures, with millions of those also including a games handset in their package. Adam Simmons, editor of magazine Pocket Gamer and organiser of the London MOBO awards for mobile phone games, said: ""2004 was a huge year for mobile gaming"". ""There are now more cell phones that play games than there are people in the UK,"" he added. ""And the number of people who play mobile games is much greater still."" The Screen Digest report found that US and Japanese developers were struggling to make original titles due to the dominance of Nintendo's handheld consoles and Sony's PlayStation2. But Mr Simmons said it was up to US developers to break into the market as they had proved themselves in console gaming. ""They make great games,"" he said. ""But they're just not making them for mobile handsets at the moment."" One of the reasons for the growth in European mobile gaming is thought to be the success of devices such as the Nokia N-Gage which combines"
tech,Tough Rules For Ringtone Sellers,"Firms that flout rules on how ringtones and other mobile extras are sold could be cut off from all UK phone networks. The rules allow offenders to be cut off if they do not let consumers know exactly what they get for their money and how to turn off the services. The first month under the new rules has seen at least ten firms suspended while they clean up the way they work. The rules have been brought in to ensure that the problems plaguing net users do not spread to mobile phones. In the last couple of years ringtones, wallpapers, screensavers and lots of other extras for phones have become hugely popular. But fierce competition is making it difficult for firms to get their wares in front of consumers, said Jeremy Flynn, head of third party services at Vodafone. ""If you are not on the operator's portal you are going to have quite heavy marketing costs because it's a problem of how people discover your services,"" he said. To combat this many ringtone and other mobile content sellers started using a new tactic to squeeze more cash out of customers. This tactic involved signing people up for a subscription to give them, for instance, several ringtones per week or month instead of the single track they thought they were getting. Mr Flynn said that the move to using subscriptions happened over the space of a few weeks at the end of 2004. Websites such as grumbletext.co.uk started getting reports from customers who were racking up large bills for phone content they did not know they had signed up for. ""What made us uncomfortable was that these services were not being marketed transparently,"" said Mr Flynn. ""People did not know they were being offered a subscription service."" ""We saw potential for substantial consumer harm here,"" he added. The swift adoption of subscription services led to the creation of a new code of conduct for firms that want to sell content for mobile phones. The drafting of the new rules was led by the Mobile Entertainment Forum and the UK's phone firms. ""Everyone is required to conform to this code of conduct,"" said Andrew Bud, regulatory head of the MEF and executive chairman of messaging firm MBlox. ""It's all about transparency,"" he said. ""Consumers have to be told what they have got themselves into and how to get out of it."" ""The consumer has a right to be protected,"" he said. Christian Harris, partnership manager of mobile content firm Zed, said the new system was essential if consumers were to trust companies that sell ringtones and other downloads. ""The groundrules must be applied across the whole industry and if that's done effectively we will see the cowboys driven out,"" he said. The new rules came in to force on 15 January and the first month under the new regime has seen many firms cautioned for not honouring them. Some have been told to revamp websites so customers know what they get for their money and what they are signing up for, said Mr Flynn. Also, said Mr Flynn, Vodafone has briefly cut off between eight and ten content sellers flouting the rules. ""We have quite draconian contracts with firms,"" he said. ""We do not have to say why. We can just cut them off."" Under the rules consumers must be able to switch off the services by using a universal ""stop"" command sent via text message. He said the system had been designed to limit how much a consumer will pay if they inadvertently signed up for a service. ""The mobile is so personal that people really resent the abuse of what is effectively part of their personality,"" said Mr Flynn.","The world's biggest mobile phone firms have drawn up tough rules to stop people flouting the law and using ringtones to promote music. The companies, which control 90% of the global market, have all signed up to a code of conduct that will harmonise the way they enforce existing rules. The firms have all agreed that they will only allow ringtones on phones as part of a promotion, and will only sell them if they are less than 30 seconds long. They are also likely to insist that ringtone makers get licences from record companies to use their music. Currently, less than 1% of songs have been licensed for use as ringtones, because many record companies and mobile phone firms are worried that they are breaking copyright laws. The firms have signed up to the code of conduct after months of discussions about how to clear up the confusion about ringtones. Harmonising the rules should see more promotions using ringtones, and should also help boost the popularity of the short music clips on mobile phones. The move will also make it easier for smaller mobile phone firms to advertise their services because they will not need to spend time and money working out how to comply with different regional rules. The move comes after a European Court of Justice ruling in October 2003 said that ringtones were more likely to be seen as a derivative work - or an adapted version - of a song, which would make them subject to copyright laws. This meant that many mobile phone firms were worried they could get into trouble if they allowed people"
tech,File-Swappers Ready New Network,"Legal attacks on websites that help people swap pirated films have forced the development of a system that could be harder to shut down. One site behind the success of the BitTorrent file-swapping system is producing its own software that avoids the pitfalls of the earlier program. A test version of the new Exeem program will be released in late January. But doubts remain about the new networks ability to ensure files being swapped are ""quality copies"". In late December movie studios launched a legal campaign against websites that helped people swap pirated movies using the BitTorrent network. The legal campaign worked because of the way that BitTorrent is organised. That file-sharing system relies on links called ""trackers"" that point users to others happy to share the file they are looking for. Shutting down sites that listed trackers crippled the BitTorrent network. One of the sites shut down by the legal campaign was suprnova.org which helped boost the popularity of the BitTorrent system by checking that trackers led to the movies or TV programmes they claimed to. Now the man behind suprnova.org, who goes by the nickname Sloncek, is preparing to release software for a new file-swapping network dubbed Exeem. In an interview with Novastream web radio, Sloncek said Exeem would combine ideas from the BitTorrent and Kazaa file-sharing systems. Like BitTorrent, Exeem will have trackers that help point people toward the file they want. Like Kazaa these trackers will be held by everyone. There will be no centrally maintained list. This, said Sloncek, should make the system less vulnerable to legal action aimed at stopping people swapping pirated movies and music. The Exeem software has been under development for a few months and is currently being tested by a closed group of users. An early public version of the software should be available before February. Sloncek said that currently only a Windows version of the software was in development. There were no plans for a Linux or Mac version. He said that costs of writing the software will be paid for by adverts appearing in the finished version of the program. Despite Suprnova administrator Sloncek's involvement with Exeem, the basic technology appears to have been developed by a firm called Swarm Systems that is based on Caribbean island Saint Kitts and Nevis. Users of the Exeem system will be able to rate files being swapped to help stop the spread of fake files, Sloncek told Novastream. Dr Johan Pouwelse, a researcher at the Delft University of Technology who studies peer-to-peer networks, said Exeem was the next evolution in file-sharing systems. But, he said, it would struggle to be as popular as BitTorrent and Suprnova because early versions were not taking enough care to make sure good copies of files were being shared. ""Exeem cannot prevent pollution,"" he said. ""The rating system in Exeem seems flawed because it is easy to insert both fake files and fake ratings,"" he said. Studies have shown that organisations working for record labels and movie studios have worked to undermine Kazaa by putting in fakes. By contrast moderators on Suprnova made sure files being shared were high quality. ""The moderators are the difference between having a system that works and one that's full of crap like Kazaa,"" he said. ""There is a fundamental tension between distribution and integrity,"" he said. Mr Pouwelse said that future versions of file-sharing systems are likely to incorporate some kind of distributed reputation system that lets moderators prove who they are to the network and rate which files are worth downloading. When big files were being shared moderation systems were key, said Mr Pouwelse. He added that the legal attacks on BitTorrent had driven people away from sites such as Suprnova but many users had simply migrated to other tracker listing sites many of which have seen huge increases in traffic. ""It's hard to compete with free,"" he said. No-one from the Motion Picture Association of America was immediately available for comment on the file-sharing development.","A group of file-sharers who swapped files without paying for them for years are preparing to launch a legal alternative to Kazaa and Grokster. The group is developing a system called Azzer, named after a former member who was sued by the music industry. Azzer will be open source and use the latest anti-piracy technology. The group said it wanted to avoid the mistakes made by previous file-sharing networks. The group developing Azzer - many of whom are US college students - got their inspiration from Justin Azzer, who lost a landmark case against record companies a few years ago. Mr Azzer created a system called Music Now, which let people share files without paying but also provided links to buy songs legally in stores. After he was sued by record labels, he stopped development and closed Music Now down. Since then, the students say they have seen no other file-sharing systems that provide similar links to legal stores. Instead, they say, Kazaa, Grokster and the other popular networks all provide links only to other people's PCs, which break the law and leave users exposed to expensive lawsuits and spyware. ""It was clear that there was no legal solution out there,"" one of the group developing Azzer told BBC News Online. ""We believe the only way to beat the music industry is with technology."" The group, who all asked not to be identified, said they had been working on Azzer in their"
tech,Players Sought For $1M Prize,"UK gamers are getting a chance to take part in a $1m tournament thanks to one of the country's top teams. The Four-Kings clan is staging a Pop Idol type competition to find new members who can take on the world's best in the lucrative tournament. Four-Kings hopes the open qualifiers will turn up gamers good enough to beat all comers at the Painkiller game. Top players also get a contract with the Four-Kings team which will pay travelling expenses for the contest. UK gamers have until 12 November to register their interest in taking part and can sign up via the Four-Kings, Jolt.co.uk and Painkiller tournament websites. Philip Wride, who co-manages the Four-Kings team, said online qualifiers will be held from 16-28 November to find the best eight players of the Painkiller game. He said the clan was running the contest because Four-Kings does not currently have any players that excel at Painkiller. These eight players will be brought together in London on 3-5 December for the Bloodline Tournament that will find the best two players. The event will be filmed and the final cut made available online for others to watch. The movie is being put together by Simon Bysshe who has shot many other films about pro-gaming that have been widely shared online. Said Mr Bysshe: ""Painkiller is a new game and the opportunity is there for a new player to step up."" Painkiller has been described as a game that adds a few modern touches, such as improved graphics, to the old-fashioned first-person shooter. These two players will be put forward as the UK's entrants to the Cyberathlete Professional League $1m Painkiller contest that will take place throughout 2005. The event is being billed as the CPL World Tour and will be arranged around ten separate tournaments at different locations around the world. Travel expenses to all the stops on the tour will be paid by Four-Kings for the two UK players who make the grade. The top prize at each stop on the world tour will be $15,000. A further $150,000 will be given to the winner of the Grand Final due to be held in December 2005. Mr Wride said any gamer that wins a few tour stop tournaments and the grand final will have a very good year. The first stop on the world tour will be Istanbul, Turkey from 10-13 February. A total of $50,000 in cash prizes is on offer. The CPL has said that it picked a one-on-one game such as Painkiller to make it easier for spectators to follow the action. Counter-Strike, by far the most popular online game, pits teams against each other and can be confusing to follow if those watching are not familiar with the layout of the maps on which it is played. The decision to pick Painkiller was greeted with surprise by many gamers, as it was widely expected that Doom 3 would be chosen as the one-one-one title.","Poker game makers PC maker Dell has launched a competition to find players for its $1m (£500,000) online poker tournament. It is asking people to submit a short video clip of themselves explaining why they should play in the World Poker Challenge. The tournament will be played over five weeks in March and April 2005. Dell will run a series of qualifying events across the US, UK, Germany, France and Italy before picking the four-player team. Players will use Dell's computers to play the tournament. ""We are excited to see who has the skills and the confidence to play for one million dollars,"" said Howard Schaffer, general manager of Dell's consumer group. ""In addition to playing on state-of-the-art Dell OptiPlex computers, our players will have access to the most advanced training and analysis tools available.""

tech,Smart Search Lets Art Fans Browse,"If you don't know art but know what you like, new search technology could prove a useful gateway to painting. ArtGarden, developed by BT's research unit, is being tested by the Tate as a new way of browsing its online collection of paintings. Rather than search by the name of an artist or painting, users are shown a selection of pictures. Clicking on their favourite will change the gallery in front of them to a selection of similar works. The technology uses a system dubbed smart serendipity, which is a combination of artificial intelligence and random selection. It 'chooses' a selection of pictures, by scoring paintings based on a selection of keywords associated with them. So, for instance a Whistler painting of a bridge may have the obvious keywords such as bridge and Whistler associated to it but will also widen the search net with terms such as aesthetic movement, 19th century and water. A variety of paintings will then be shown to the user, based partly on the keywords and partly on luck. ""It is much more akin to wandering through the gallery,"" said Jemima Rellie, head of the Tate's digital programme. For Richard Tateson, who worked on the ArtGarden project, the need for a new way to search grew out of personal frustration. ""I went to an online clothes store to find something to buy my wife for Christmas but I didn't have a clue what I wanted,"" he said. The text-based search was restricted to looking either by type of garment or designer, neither of which he found helpful. He ended up doing his present shopping on the high street instead. He thinks the dominance of text-based searching is not necessarily appealing to the majority of online shoppers. Similarly, with art, browsing is often more important than finding a particular object. ""You don't arrive at Tate Britain and tell people what you want to see. One of the skills of showing off the collection is to introduce people to things they wouldn't have asked for,"" he said. The Tate is committed to making its art more accessible and technology such as ArtGarden can help with that, said Ms Rellie. She hopes the technology can be incorporated on to the website in the near future. BT research is looking at extending the technology to other searching, such as for music and films.","A new website which lets people search and browse art online has been launched. The British Museum's World of Art site lets people search by country, period, artist or material to find material in its collection. The site is part of the museum's continuing drive to make its treasures more accessible on the web. The site is part of the museum's ongoing drive to make its treasures more accessible on the web. The World of Art site is the third in a series of sites the museum has launched this year - other sites have focused on ancient Egypt and Chinese art. The new site is designed to make it easier for people to find specific objects in the museum's vast collection of 6 million objects - which include one of the world's largest collection of Chinese art. Using the site is simple - after entering the main page of the site, users enter search terms into a box. The site then presents a list of results that are split into categories such as ""Europe"", ""Asia"" or ""Oceania"". Clicking on a category then brings up a list of sub-categories that can be clicked on. Each category also includes an option to search the museum's archive - which contains more than two million images. Once a particular image is clicked on, a separate window opens up with a larger version of the image. Each image also includes information about where it was taken, how old it is and what it depicts.

tech,Loyalty Cards Idea For Tv Addicts,"Viewers could soon be rewarded for watching TV as loyalty cards come to a screen near you. Any household hooked up to Sky could soon be using smartcards in conjunction with their set-top boxes. Broadcasters such as Sky and ITV could offer viewers loyalty points in return for watching a particular channel or programme. Sky will activate a spare slot on set-top boxes in January, marketing magazine New Media Age reported. Sky set-top boxes have two slots. One is for the viewer's decryption card, while the other has been dormant until now. Loyalty cards have become a common addition to most wallets, as High Street brands rush to keep customers with a series of incentives offered by store cards. Now similar schemes look set to enter the highly competitive world of multi-channel TV. Viewers who stay loyal to a particular TV channel could be rewarded by free TV content or freebies from retail partners. Broadcasters aiming content at children could offer smartcards which gives membership to exclusive content and clubs. ""Parents could pre-pay for some content, as a kind of TV pocket money card,"" said Nigel Whalley, managing director of media consultancy Decipher. Viewers could even be rewarded for watching ad breaks, with ideas such as ad bingo being touted by firms keen to make money out of the new market, said Mr Whalley. Credit cards that have been chipped could be used in set-top boxes to pay for movies, gambling and gaming. ""The idea of an intelligent card in boxes offers a lot of possibilities. It will be down to the ingenuity of the content players,"" said Mr Whalley. For the BBC, revenue-generating activity will be of little interest but the new development may prompt changes to Freeview set-top boxes, said Mr Whalley. Currently most Freeview boxes do not have a slot which would allow viewers to use a smartcard. Some 7.4 million households have Sky boxes and Sky is hoping to increase this to 10 million by 2010. Loyalty cards could play a role in this, particularly in reducing the number of people who cancel their Sky subscriptions, said Ian Fogg, an analyst with Jupiter Research.","TV firms should use loyalty cards to reward loyal viewers and punish those who download programmes illegally, a US media analyst has said. Paul Dempsey told a Royal Television Society conference there was no longer any point trying to stop illegal file sharers. But he said it was vital to make programmes available to more people and help viewers find programmes they would like. Many firms are developing technologies to help viewers find material they will like and which suits their needs. But Mr Dempsey told the RTS audience in London that firms should be doing more to reward those who legally watch shows on TV and punish those who watch shows illegally. ""Companies need to start rewarding the loyal viewers,"" he said. ""The viewer who is watching your programmes legally and paying you money through the subscription, cable or pay-per-view model, they need to be rewarded."" Mr Dempsey, who is a partner in Frost & Sullivan's consultancy group, said that tools were already available to let firms identify those who download programmes illegally on file-sharing networks. ""If you know someone has downloaded your content illegally - a programme or a movie - you can turn off their broadband service for a period of time,"" he said. ""It is called 'punishing the pirate' and it will happen in the US within a year or so."" Mr Dempsey said that it was also important for new technology to help firms provide shows to viewers when they want them. He said that viewers were increasingly turning to downloading files on peer-to-peer file-sharing"
tech,Gangsters Dominate Gaming Chart,"Video games on consoles and computers proved more popular than ever in 2004. Gamers spent more than £1.34bn in 2004, almost 7% more than they did in 2003 according to figures released by the UK gaming industry's trade body. Sales records were smashed by the top title of the year GTA: San Andreas - in which players got the job of turning central character CJ into a crime boss. The game sold more than 1 million copies in the first nine days that it was on sale. This feat made it the fastest selling video game of all time in the UK. Although only released in November the sprawling story of guns, gangsters game beat off strong competition and by year end had sold more than 1.75 million copies. There were also records set for the number of games that achieved double-platinum status by selling more than 600,000 copies. Five titles, including Sony EyeToy Play and EA's Need for Speed: Underground 2, managed this feat according to figures compiled by Chart-Track for the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (Elspa). Electronic Arts, the world's biggest games publisher, had 9 games in the top 20. 2004 was a ""stellar year"" said Roger Bennett, director general of Elspa. ""In a year with no new generation consoles being released, the market continued to be buoyant as the industry matured and the increasingly diverse range of games reached new audiences and broadened its player base - across ages and gender,"" he said. Part of the success of games in 2004 could be due to the fact that so many of them are sequels. 16 out of the top 20 titles were all follow-ups to established franchises or direct sequels to previously popular games. Halo, The Sims, Driver, Need for Speed, Fifa football, Burnout were just a few that proved as popular as the original titles. Despite this fondness for older games, Doom 3 did not make it to the top 20. Movie tie-ins also proved their worth in 2004. Games linked to Shrek, The Incredibles, Spider-Man, Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings were all in the top 20. Elspa noted that sales of Xbox games rose 37.9% during the year. However, Sony's PlayStation 2 was the top seller with 47% of the £1.34bn spent on games in 2004 used to buy titles for that console. Despite winning awards and rave reviews Half-Life 2 did not appear in the list. This was because it was only released on PC and, compared to console titles, sold in relatively small numbers. Also the novel distribution system adopted by developer Valve meant that many players downloaded the title rather than travel to the shops to buy a copy. Valve has yet to release figures which show how many copies of the game were sold in this way.","UK music sales organisation the BPI has named 50 Cent as the artist with the most UK sales in 2004. The rapper's album Get Rich or Die Tryin' sold more than 363,000 copies in the UK during the year, putting him ahead of Eminem. The BPI's annual chart is dominated by video games, with 50 Cent followed by PlayStation 2 title Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and its sequel GTA: Vice City. Eminem came sixth with his chart-topping album Encore. R&B artist Ms Dynamite was named best British artist, with her album A Little Deeper selling more than a quarter of a million copies. But the figures came under fire from the music industry, with Geoff Taylor, chief executive of the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), saying the BPI chart was ""little more than a novelty"". ""It should be called the video games and DVD/CD sales chart,"" he said. ""The BPI's singles and album charts are recognised across the world as providing an accurate barometer of what British music fans are listening to throughout the year. ""This isn't reflected in the BPI's annual chart."" The BPI's chart compares sales of video games and DVDs with those of singles and albums, but does not include legal downloads. The organisation said that its figures showed that British artists' album sales were up 5% on 2003 and that UK music fans spent £1.5bn on music during 2004 - an increase of 6%"
