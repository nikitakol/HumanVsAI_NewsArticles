Novartis, which last month forecast record sales for 2005, said it had bought all of Germany\\'s Hexal. It also acquired 67.7% of Hexal\\'s US affiliate Eon Labs, and offered to buy the remaining shares for $31 each. Novartis said that it would be able to make cost savings of about $200m a year following the acquisitions. Novartis\\' shares rose 1% to 57.85 Swiss francs in early trading. The deal will see Novartis\\' Sandoz business overtake Israel\\'s Teva Pharmaceuticals as the world\\'s biggest maker of generics. Based on 2004 figures the newly merged producer would have sales of more than $5bn, the company estimated. Novartis said that it would merge a number of departments, adding that there may be job cuts. \"The strong growth outlook for Sandoz, which will create jobs, is expected to partially compensate for necessary reductions in the work force,\" the firm said in a statement. Generic drugs are chemically identical to their more expensive branded rivals. Producers such as Sandoz can copy the branded products usually after their patent protection expires and can sell them more cheaply as they do not have to pay research and development cost. There are more than 150 generic drugmakers worldwide and analysts have predicted consolidation in a market that they call fragmented.

The short-term music rental service lets consumers download and keep albums for periods of up to 28 days. They can then choose to download another album, or simply delete the music at the end of the rental period. The service costs about $4 (£2.50) per album, with a cap of $15 a month. Napster hopes the move will boost its profile and help it become profitable. The service is a further step along the path that Napster has been following since it closed down its unlicensed file-sharing service last year. It wants to become a legitimate online music store that serves consumers\\' desire to own music, but also their desire to fill gaps in their collections with limited amounts of music. The new service works in much the same way as the old Napster did, except that now the tracks users download are not permanent, but are rented rather than owned. Currently only about 20% of online music users actually pay for tracks they download. The new service is designed to tempt some of those freeloaders into paying for what they listen to - and also to entice them to try out new bands or genres, because they can try out an album for a month before deciding whether or not to keep it permanently. \"Napster 2.0 is about providing consumers with a legal alternative to piracy,\" said Napster chief executive Chris Gorham. \"It\\'s',\n"," \"Next-generation game consoles are expected to hit the shops over the next year or so, but what exactly is going to make them different from the current crop of machines? A lot of questions remain about how the next wave of machines will shape up, but one thing is for sure - they will have to add something special to pep up the current console market. The sales figures for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 have been a little disappointing during the last six months. Some analysts claim that the console market as a whole has peaked, and that the growth in sales over the past few years was fuelled by pent-up demand for games machines that had been delayed for a number of years. As such, it is unlikely that this downturn in sales will be reversed by the arrival of new consoles. But what are the changes that are likely to appear in the next generation? One thing that almost certainly won't happen is a shift to completely new game engines. It is unlikely that any of the three most likely contenders to be next-gen consoles will want to spend months developing a completely new set of tools and technology just so they can offer slightly prettier versions of current games. They might want to offer prettier versions of current games, of course, but they will also want to offer something more. One thing that might help boost sales is simply offering more storage space for gamers' saved games, music and video files. The current generation of consoles has offered a minimum storage capacity of between 16MB and 32\",\n"," 'Apple has launched a new version of its Mac Mini computer which is aimed at consumers. It is a smaller version of the firm\\'s main desktop computer, with a more compact design and more powerful components. The Mac Mini costs $599 (£321) but does not include a monitor, keyboard or mouse, which pushes the total cost up to $849 (£460). It is also more powerful than Microsoft\\'s Xbox computer. The new model has a 1.8GHz processor and a 100GB hard drive. \"Apple has once again reshaped the desktop PC market,\" said Charles Arthur, editor of the technology news website The Next Platform. He said the Mac Mini was \"a very powerful computer for the price\" and compared it to Microsoft\\'s ZXDS project which is intended to offer an alternative to the Xbox games console. \"It\\'s interesting that Apple is going after this market with such a powerful machine,\" Mr Arthur told BBC News. The new Mac Mini is also the latest incarnation of what was the first of Apple\\'s computers to be offered without a monitor, keyboard or mouse, in an attempt to drive up sales. It follows in the footsteps of the iMac which was introduced in 1998 and has since been updated twice. Apple has taken on board some of the recent design trends with its new machine, which has an aluminium case as opposed to plastic. The Mac Mini can be controlled remotely via a broadband or wi-fi connection, and can also function as a server - allowing other computers to',\n"," 'The future of the internet and online activity is going to be debated by MPs on Thursday as part of a Westminster inquiry into e-commerce. The Commons Business Innovation and Skills committee meeting will also look at legal issues and how the media is adapting to the web. The government has already pledged to bring in tough new laws governing net users. A public consultation on how the internet should be regulated in the UK closed earlier this month. A report from the committee will be published in June. The meeting comes just days after a US presidential panel recommended that all net users should be required to show their real names when signing up for websites. The Bush administration is also mulling over how best to regulate the internet and has said it will decide how it will tackle the issue by summer. The issue of online regulation is set to dominate the Westminster debate on Thursday. The e-commerce meeting is being chaired by Labour MP Adrian Bailey, who said that it was vital to have an informed opinion before any decisions were made in the UK. \"The government\\'s Green Paper on online identity provided an important opportunity for MPs to voice their opinions,\" he said. \"It is vital that before any legislation is proposed, MPs get a chance to debate issues such as privacy, security and consumer protection.\" The government\\'s Green Paper on online identity called for views on proposals for a \"universal access\" system that would allow people to use one name and password for all websites. It also asked for suggestions about how best to protect children from harmful',\n"," 'The annual CeBIT technology fair in Hanover is traditionally the place where the latest consumer gadgetry is unveiled for the first time. This year is no exception and the gadgetry on show is expected to be eye-catching and innovative. BBC News went to CeBIT with a group of technology and science bloggers to find out what will be making its debut. Here are some of the highlights that caught our eye. One of the most eagerly anticipated new products is the Nokia N800 tablet computer. It is Nokia\\'s first product to run on the open-source Linux operating system, and it has been in development for three years. The N800 has a colour screen, a full-sized keyboard and can connect to the internet via wi-fi and Bluetooth. For example, it can be used as a remote control for a hi-fi or a television. The tablet computer can also act as a bridge between a desktop computer and the internet, allowing it to be used as a second monitor. As well as being able to access websites, it can also run programmes such as OpenOffice, which mimics Microsoft Office. \"The N800 could potentially be an important platform for lots of developers,\" said Andrew \\'bunty\\' Allen from gadget website Pocketlint. He said that it was important for Nokia to come up with something that made the company different from other mobile phone manufacturers. The N800 should be available in Europe by late April or early May, but will not be sold in the US',\n"," 'UK-based developers are producing some of the most innovative mobile phone games, according to a survey. The report, from analyst firm Screen Digest, said the UK had produced more \"innovative\" games than any other country. The study rated games on their graphics, control and originality, with UK developers holding the top four places. Mobile phone gaming is growing in popularity and firms are cashing in on growing sales of handsets. More than 23 million mobiles were sold across Europe in 2004, according to Screen Digest\\'s figures, with millions of those also including a games handset in their package. Adam Simmons, editor of magazine Pocket Gamer and organiser of the London MOBO awards for mobile phone games, said: \"2004 was a huge year for mobile gaming\". \"There are now more cell phones that play games than there are people in the UK,\" he added. \"And the number of people who play mobile games is much greater still.\" The Screen Digest report found that US and Japanese developers were struggling to make original titles due to the dominance of Nintendo\\'s handheld consoles and Sony\\'s PlayStation2. But Mr Simmons said it was up to US developers to break into the market as they had proved themselves in console gaming. \"They make great games,\" he said. \"But they\\'re just not making them for mobile handsets at the moment.\" One of the reasons for the growth in European mobile gaming is thought to be the success of devices such as the Nokia N-Gage which combines',\n"," \"The world's biggest mobile phone firms have drawn up tough rules to stop people flouting the law and using ringtones to promote music. The companies, which control 90% of the global market, have all signed up to a code of conduct that will harmonise the way they enforce existing rules. The firms have all agreed that they will only allow ringtones on phones as part of a promotion, and will only sell them if they are less than 30 seconds long. They are also likely to insist that ringtone makers get licences from record companies to use their music. Currently, less than 1% of songs have been licensed for use as ringtones, because many record companies and mobile phone firms are worried that they are breaking copyright laws. The firms have signed up to the code of conduct after months of discussions about how to clear up the confusion about ringtones. Harmonising the rules should see more promotions using ringtones, and should also help boost the popularity of the short music clips on mobile phones. The move will also make it easier for smaller mobile phone firms to advertise their services because they will not need to spend time and money working out how to comply with different regional rules. The move comes after a European Court of Justice ruling in October 2003 said that ringtones were more likely to be seen as a derivative work - or an adapted version - of a song, which would make them subject to copyright laws. This meant that many mobile phone firms were worried they could get into trouble if they allowed people\",\n"," 'A group of file-sharers who swapped files without paying for them for years are preparing to launch a legal alternative to Kazaa and Grokster. The group is developing a system called Azzer, named after a former member who was sued by the music industry. Azzer will be open source and use the latest anti-piracy technology. The group said it wanted to avoid the mistakes made by previous file-sharing networks. The group developing Azzer - many of whom are US college students - got their inspiration from Justin Azzer, who lost a landmark case against record companies a few years ago. Mr Azzer created a system called Music Now, which let people share files without paying but also provided links to buy songs legally in stores. After he was sued by record labels, he stopped development and closed Music Now down. Since then, the students say they have seen no other file-sharing systems that provide similar links to legal stores. Instead, they say, Kazaa, Grokster and the other popular networks all provide links only to other people\\'s PCs, which break the law and leave users exposed to expensive lawsuits and spyware. \"It was clear that there was no legal solution out there,\" one of the group developing Azzer told BBC News Online. \"We believe the only way to beat the music industry is with technology.\" The group, who all asked not to be identified, said they had been working on Azzer in their',\n"," 'Poker game makers PC maker Dell has launched a competition to find players for its $1m (£500,000) online poker tournament.

Dell will run a series of qualifying events across the US, UK, Germany, France and Italy before picking the four-player team. Players will use Dell\\'s computers to play the tournament. \"We are excited to see who has the skills and the confidence to play for one million dollars,\" said Howard Schaffer, general manager of Dell\\'s consumer group. \"In addition to playing on state-of-the-art Dell OptiPlex computers, our players will have access to the most advanced training and analysis tools available.\" The company is running similar competitions in the UK and US.

Paul Dempsey told a Royal Television Society conference there was no longer any point trying to stop illegal file sharers. But he said it was vital to make programmes available to more people and help viewers find programmes they would like. Many firms are developing technologies to help viewers find material they will like and which suits their needs. But Mr Dempsey told the RTS audience in London that firms should be doing more to reward those who legally watch shows on TV and punish those who watch shows illegally. \"Companies need to start rewarding the loyal viewers,\" he said. \"The viewer who is watching your programmes legally and paying you money through the subscription, cable or pay-per-view model, they need to be rewarded.\" Mr Dempsey, who is a partner in Frost & Sullivan\\'s consultancy group, said that tools were already available to let firms identify those who download programmes illegally on file-sharing networks. \"If you know someone has downloaded your content illegally - a programme or a movie - you can turn off their broadband service for a period of time,\" he said. \"It is called \\'punishing the pirate\\' and it will happen in the US within a year or so.\" Mr Dempsey said that it was also important for new technology to help firms provide shows to viewers when they want them. He said that viewers were increasingly turning to downloading files on peer-to-peer file-sharing',\n"," 'UK music sales organisation the BPI has named 50 Cent as the artist with the most UK sales in 2004.

The BPI\\'s annual chart is dominated by video games, with 50 Cent followed by PlayStation 2 title Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and its sequel GTA: Vice City. Eminem came sixth with his chart-topping album Encore. R&B artist Ms Dynamite was named best British artist, with her album A Little Deeper selling more than a quarter of a million copies. But the figures came under fire from the music industry, with Geoff Taylor, chief executive of the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), saying the BPI chart was \"little more than a novelty\". \"It should be called the video games and DVD/CD sales chart,\" he said. \"The BPI\\'s singles and album charts are recognised across the world as providing an accurate barometer of what British music fans are listening to throughout the year. \"This isn\\'t reflected in the BPI\\'s annual chart.\" The BPI\\'s chart compares sales of video games and DVDs with those of singles and albums, but does not include legal downloads.
